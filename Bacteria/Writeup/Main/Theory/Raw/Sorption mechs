Chemical adsorption on sludge derived biochar SDBC: Cation release: Metal exhchange with Ca2+ and Mg 2+, K+, Na+ to form stable complexes or precipitates, functional groups complexation. Lu found that approximately 38.2-42.3\% was from organic hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups, and 57.7-61.8\% from coprecipitation or complex on mineral surfaces led to a bulk of Ca2+ and Mg2+. . FT-IR, XRD and SEM-EDX used to identify chemical functional groups present on original and Pb loaded SDBC. No electrolyte soln used to prevent concealment. Mechanism determintion: functional group blocking. R-COOH and R-OH main groups main groups contributing to coordination between heavy metals and sorbent surfaces. 9.0 g of SDBC was continuously mixed with 633 ml ofanhydrous CH3OH and 5.4 ml of 0.1 mol L1 HCl with a 100 rpm magnetic stirrer for 6 h to block the carboxyl function groups. the blocking process does not change the charge on the surface of the sorbents.deionized water to remove the excessive HCl and CH3OH. Increase in pH is more favourable: hydrolyzed Pb2+ more readily sorbed and has less electrical repulsion tahn free Pb2+, and hydroxyl groups deprotonated can increase surface charge. \parencite{Lu2012}

Biosorption is usually modelled with empirical models (freund+lang) and mechanistic models. Empirical cant account for pH. NB check out esposito, source 11. Most literature reports two mechanistic models: surface complex formation and ion exchange models 
Four types of complexation: protonated, unidentate, bindentate, bridging: good figure
High complicacy of various types of  complexation structures created by metal and carboxyl/ether/alcoholic/hydroxyl/amino func groups, modelling is reduced to two mechanisms.
Mechanistic model that looks at two basic rxns: H+ and L to HL as well as M2+ + jL = ML**(2-j) for alkaline earth metals and Pb2+ \parencite{Chen2006}


Adsorption mechanism. Vem (value of exchange mechanism) = (total Pb2+ ads mmol/g)/(mmol/g of Ca2+ released 	+ mmol/g of K released) - If Vem is less than unity (Vem $\le$ 1), the ion exchange mechanism should play a vital role and other mechanisms might be or might not be active. On the other hand, if Vem is higher than unity (Vem $\ge$ 1), other mechanisms must play a strong role besides the ionic exchange in the biosorption process.Ionic exchange of Ca(II): [T-(Ca2+)n](s) +n Pb2+(aq) = [T-(Pb2+)n](s) +n Ca2+ (aq) \textit{Colocasiaesculenta}(L.)
