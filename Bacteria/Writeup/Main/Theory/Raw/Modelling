Ususally empircals are not developed for biosorption and assumptions do not apply, but have been shown to reflect experimental work.


\textit{Equilibrium} The Langmuir isotherm model is frequently used under the assumption of a fixed number of sites where reversible, monolayer adsorption takes place with no interaction between adsorbate species  \parencite{Tran2017} and can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
q_e=\frac{q_{\mathrm{max}}K_LC_e}{1+K_LC_e} \label{eq:5}
\end{align}
Where $q_{\mathrm{max}}$ is the amount od adsorbate on the adsorbent at equilibrium maximum saturated monolayer adsorption capacity (mg/g), $K_L$ is the Langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant (L/mg) related to affinity between adsorbate and adsorbent, and $C_e$ is the equilibrium concentration of Pb(II) in solution (mg/L).

The Freundlich isotherm equation describes reversible, non-ideal, multilayer adsorption and is usually used for heterogenous adsorbents like biomass \parencite{Foo2010}. This model has, however, been found to inadequately describe the linearity range at very low concentrations or saturation effects at very high concentrations \parencite{Tran2017}. The Freundlich equation can be expressed as 
\begin{align}
q_e=K_FC_e^n \label{eq:6}
\end{align}
Where $K_F$ is the Freundlich constant in (mg/g)/(mg/L)$^n$ and $n$ is the Freundlich intensity parameter. The isotherm is linear when $n=1$, favourable when $n \le 1$, and unfavourable when $n \ge 1$ \parencite{Tran2017}.

The Langmuir-Freundlich model is a three parameter power function based on the assumption of continuously distributed affinity coefficients \parencite{Bolster2007} and is represented in Equation \ref{eq:7}.
\begin{align}
q_e=\frac{q_{\mathrm{max}}K_{LF}C_e^\beta}{1+K_{LF}C_e^\beta} \label{eq:7}
\end{align}
Here, $K_{LF}$ is the Langmuir-Freundlich constant in (L/mg)$^\beta$ and $\beta$ is a fitting parameter between 0 and 1. The two-surface Langmuir model is employed upon the assumption that adsorption takes place on two surfaces with differing bonding energies and is expressed in Equation \ref{eq:8}.
\begin{align}
q_e=\frac{q_{\mathrm{max,\ 1}}K_{L1}C_e}{1+K_{L1}C_e}+\frac{q_{\mathrm{max,\ 2}}K_{L2}C_e}{1+K_{L2}C_e} \label{eq:8}
\end{align}
The enumeration in the subscripts indicate which of the two surfaces the parameter belongs to.
