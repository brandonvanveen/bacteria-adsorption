\parencite{Zhang2017} \textit{Bacillus subtilis} Important role in resisting shock loading. Complex, high weight molecular mixture of polymers composed of proteins, polysaccharides and humic subst. Envelops cell surface to form protective barrier. Hydroxyl, carboxyl, phosphate and amide groups. Binding to EPS prevents binding of lead to other func groups. 

\parencite{Wang2014} Abundance of negatively charged functional groups. Mainly consists of polysaccharides, protein and nucleic acids. \textit{Desulfovibrio desulfuricans}. Mainly triptophan-like substances that bound with heavmets. Binding capacity of EPS was respectively 899.1 and 932.1 mg/g EPS for Cu2+ and Zn2+.

\parencite{Liu2002} EPS consists of carbohydrate protein humic subs, + small quant of uronic acid and DNA. Def EPS: metabolic products accumulating on cell surface. Protective layerfor cells and serve as carbon and energy reserves during starvation. Extraction method for eps.

" Also had table for Pb ads bacteria

\parencite{Vijayaraghavan2008} Table of bacteria. Shapes: spherical (like \textit{Streptococcus}), rod (like \textit{Bacillus}), spiral (like) and filamentous. Peptidoglycan: rigidity of cell wall plus shape. Gram positive: thick peptidoglycan layer (90 \%) connected by amino acid bridges. Teichoic acids link peptidoglycan to cytoplasmic membrane and give cell wall overall positive charge. Gram neg have only 10-20\% peptidoglycan, but with outer cell membrane of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides (lipopol confers negative charge). In G+, pept, teichoic acids, teichuronic acids and in G-, pept, phospholipids and lipopols responsible for anionic character and metal binding capability of cell wall. 

\parencite{Wang2009} spherical or ovoid (coccus), rod (bacillus), spiral (spirillum). G+ single, homogenous peptidog layer, 20 - 80 nm thick, 40 - 90\% of cell wall. Lipoteichoic acids extend through peptidog and to outer surface. G- is much more complex,  30 - 80 nm thick . peptidog is sandwhiched between plasma membrane and outer membrane, composed of phospholipids, lipopolysaccharides, enzymes and other proteins. Some bacteria produce loose slimes above bacterial cell wall, composing of loosely arranged carbohydrates and proteins. Also has a table of Pb ads bacteria.
