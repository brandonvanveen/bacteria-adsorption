\parencite{Fomina2014} physico-chemical, metabolically independent processbased on a variety of mechanisms. Removal of substances by biological material. "Thus, the term biosorption can apparently describe any system where a solid sur- face of a biological matrix interacts with a sorbate resulting in the reduction in the solution sorbate concentration"

Adsorption is a mass transfer process whereby pollutants from the liquid phase to the solid adsorbent. Adv: simple design, low price, easy maintenance and high efficiency \parencite{Wang2020}

Umbrella term for sorbate in solution decreases due to attractive forces between sorbate and biosorbent. an adsorption mechanism to materials of biological origin. \parencite{Robalds2016}
