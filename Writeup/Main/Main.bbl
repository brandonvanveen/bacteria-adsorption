      \field{abstract}{The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximurn likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AlC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples. © 1974, IEEE. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Silicate mesoporous materials have received widespread interest because of their potential applications as supports for catalysis, separation, selective adsorption, novel functional materials, and use as hosts to confine guest molecules, due to their extremely high surface areas combined with large and uniform pore sizes. Over time a constant demand has developed for larger pores with well-defined pore structures. Silicate materials, with well-defined pore sizes of about 2.0-10.0 nm, surpass the pore-size constraint (<2.0 nm) of microporous zeolites. They also possess extremely high surface areas (>700 m2 g-1) and narrow pore size distributions. Instead of using small organic molecules as templating compounds, as in the case of zeolites, long chain surfactant molecules were employed as the structure-directing agent during the synthesis of these highly ordered materials. The structure, composition, and pore size of these materials can be tailored during synthesis by variation of the reactant stoichiometry, the nature of the surfactant molecule, the auxiliary chemicals, the reaction conditions, or by post-synthesis functionalization techniques. This review focuses mainly on a concise overview of silicate mesoporous materials together with their applications. Perusal of the review will enable researchers to obtain succinct information about microporous and mesoporous materials. © 2012 by the authors.}

      \field{abstract}{Biosorption is a promising technology which pays attention to fabricate novel, cheap (low-cost) and highly-effective materials to apply in wastewater purification technology. Algae belong to a multi applicable group, which can contribute to important sectors. Their major use is to produce a wide range of primary and secondary metabolites, which applied to food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Moreover, algae have been suggested as potential feedstock for bioenergy and biofuel production. This review article collects information from published works of the last two years (2014 and 2015), discussing about the alternative use of different algae (micro and macro) in raw or modified form as promising biosorbents for water or wastewater decontamination. Some important adsorption paths were criticized as the stage of (i) equilibrium (isotherms), (ii) kinetic, and (iii) desorption. For this purpose, many factors which influence the adsorption process, such as the effect of solution pH, contact time, temperature and adsorbent's dose, were also discussed.}

      \field{abstract}{Persistent heavy metal pollution poses a major threat to all life forms in the environment due to its toxic effects. These metals are very reactive at low concentrations and can accumulate in the food web, causing severe public health concerns. Remediation using conventional physical and chemical methods is uneconomical and generates large volumes of chemical waste. Bioremediation of hazardous metals has received considerable and growing interest over the years. The use of microbial biosorbents is eco-friendly and cost effective; hence, it is an efficient alternative for the remediation of heavy metal contaminated environments. Microbes have various mechanisms of metal sequestration that hold greater metal biosorption capacities. The goal of microbial biosorption is to remove and/or recover metals and metalloids from solutions, using living or dead biomass and their components. This review discusses the sources of toxic heavy metals and describes the groups of microorganisms with biosorbent potential for heavy metal removal.}

      \field{abstract}{The kinetics of sorption from a solution onto an adsorbent has been explored theoretically. The general analytical solution was obtained for two cases. It has been shown that at high initial concentration of solute (sorbate) the general equation converts to a pseudo-first-order model and at lower initial concentration of solute it converts to a pseudo-second-order model. In other words, the sorption process obeys pseudo-first-order kinetics at high initial concentration of solute, while it obeys pseudo-second-order kinetics model at lower initial concentration of solute. The theoretical results (derived equations) show that the observed rate constants of pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order models are combinations of adsorption and desorption rate constants and also initial concentration of solute. The obtained theoretical equations are used to correlate experimental data for sorption kinetics of some solutes on various sorbents. The predictions of the theory are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{One of the most commonly used models for describing solute sorption to soils is the Langmuir model. Because the Langmuir model is nonlinear, fitting the model to sorption data requires that the model be solved iteratively using an optimization program. To avoid the use of optimization programs, a linearized version of the Langmuir model is often used so that model parameters can be obtained by linear regression. Although the linear and nonlinear Langmuir equations are mathematically equivalent, there are several limitations to using linearized Langmuir equations. We examined the limitations of using linearized Langmuir equations by fitting P sorption data collected on eight different soils with four linearized versions of the Langmuir equation and comparing goodness-of-fit measures and fitted parameter values with those obtained with the nonlinear Langmuir equation. We then fit the sorption data with two modified versions of the Langmuir model and assessed whether the fits were statistically superior to the original Langmuir equation. Our results demonstrate that the use of linearized Langmuir equations needlessly limits the ability to model sorption data with good accuracy. To encourage the testing of additional nonlinear sorption models, we have made available an easily used Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (ars.usda.gov/msa/awmru/bolster/Sorption{\_}spreadsheets) capable of generating best-fit parameters and their standard errors and confidence intervals, correlations between fitted parameters, and goodness-of-fit measures. The results of our study should promote more critical evaluation of model fits to sorption data and encourage the testing of more sophisticated sorption models.}

      \field{abstract}{© Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l. The objective of the current study was to explore the lead removal capabilities of two locally sourced industrial consortia using batch fermenters. The consortia were obtained from lead contaminated soil at a) a lead mine and b) an automotive battery recycling plant. The experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions using a rich growth medium (Luria Bertani Broth) with two different background lead concentrations (80 mg/L and 160 mg/L). The influence of added glucose to the medium was also studied. The residual aqueous lead was used as a measure of the lead removal capacity. Findings attest to the effectiveness of the industrially obtained consortia at removing lead from solution for both lead concentrations. Lead removal of between 91{\%} and 93{\%} in 168 hours and between 63{\%} and 76{\%} in 240 hours were achieved for the 80 mg/L and 160 mg/L experiments respectively. Minimal change was measured in the absorbances of these experiments, indicating a non-growth related lead removal mechanism. A glucose concentration of 60 g/L caused severe substrate inhibition which reduced the lead removal effectiveness to between 5{\%} and 30{\%} over a 214-hour period. The results for both consortia displayed significant similarities, indicating that analogous strains of organisms were present and active under the specific conditions.}

      \field{abstract}{Copyright © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l. The objective of the study was to explore the influence of various growth substrates on the removal of aqueous lead from solution. The fermentation media tested consisted of glucose- and xylose-supplemented LB-broth, with and without CaCO 3 as pH buffer. In addition, combinations of the various constituents of LB-broth, i.e. yeast extract, tryptone, and NaCl, were tested. Results from the sugar-supplement runs showed that significant removal of lead, without observable precipitation, was measured both with and without pH buffering (75-90{\%} in 48-72 hours). Significant gas build-up in all runs, and a drop in pH in the unbufferred runs, indicate an anaerobic digestion mechanism with either internal or external sequestration of lead. The LB-broth constituent experiments indicate that even though the commercial growth medium LB-broth exhibited the best performance in terms of lead(II) removal (89{\%}), yeast extract-NaCl complex medium performed nearly as well (80{\%}). Results show that substituting the tryptone with corn steep liquor provided minimal gains in lead removal performance, compared to the yeast extract-NaCl medium. The aqueous lead removed by the yeast extract-only medium was limited to 56{\%} in 144 hours. Dark grey precipitates and pH values greater than 5 indicate that the lead(II) were reduced to elemental lead. The observations also suggest that the growth factors in the LB broth, required by the consortium, can be largely replaced by the yeast extract-NaCl medium.}

      \field{abstract}{For the first time we apply a new method based on the mathematical derivation of some known isotherm from the Burr function which describes many birth-death (sorption-desorption) phenomena in ecology and economy. Therefore, in this study the experimental isotherm data of biosorption of Pb(II) onto algae was modeled to Langmuir, Hill-Sips, Brouers-Sotolongo, Brouers-Gaspard, and Redlich-Peterson isotherm models. The parameters of each model were determined by nonlinear fitting algorithms using Mathematica program. The maximum Pb(II) removal rate increased with the increase of temperature and reached the maximum value (98{\%}) at the temperature of 40 °C. The results showed that the Hill-Sips and the Brouers-Sotolongo isotherms were definitely the most suitable models to satisfactorily describe biosorption of Pb(II) on the algal biomass. In addition, as these two models gave very close results, the use of an intermediate one the Brouers-Gaspard isotherm model could also describe the sorption in most cases. High coefficient of determination values was obtained by using nonlinear methods and these findings are contrary to most works in this field that use linearization methods. Further, this study showed that a complete set of data is necessary to have a good representation of the isotherm and using only coefficient of determination is not always an adequate tool to compare the goodness of the nonlinear fit of an isotherm models.}

      \field{abstract}{High surface area activated carbons were produced by thermal activation of waste bamboo scaffolding with phosphoric acid. Single component equilibrium dye adsorption was conducted on the carbons produced and compared with a commercially available carbon. Two acid dyes with different molecular sizes, namely Acid Yellow 117 (AY117) and Acid Blue 25 (AB25), were used to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the produced carbons. It was found that the dye with smaller molecular size, AB 25, was readily adsorbed onto the produced carbon, nearly three times higher than a commercially available carbon, while the larger size dye, AY117, showed little adsorption. The experimental data were analyzed using isotherm equations including Langmuir, Freundlich, Tempkin, Toth, Redlich-Peterson and Sips equations. The equilibrium data were then analyzed using five different non-linear error analysis methods. © 2012 Chemical Industry and Engineering Society of China (CIESC) and Chemical Industry Press (CIP).}

      \field{abstract}{Lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) have been engineered onto the cell surface of E. coli to enhance biosorption and recovery of rare earth elements (REEs). The protonation behavior of the bacterial surfaces before and after LBT-display was compared by modeling acid-base titration data. A multiple discrete site, constant capacitance surface complexation model was constructed to examine rare earth (Tb) binding to cell surface functional groups, comparing wild type and LBT-engineered surfaces. Our acid-base titrations show similar pKa values between the two strains, suggesting induction of LBTs does not significantly alter cell surface protonation behavior. Tb sorption onto the wild type cell surface can be captured by a one-site carboxyl model. The LBT strain exhibited a higher metal loading that can be explained by the increase of sorption sites in the form of lanthanide binding tags. Furthermore, carboxyl site concentrations between wild type and LBT-induced cells were statistically indistinguishable. We thus attribute the engineered strains' increase in Tb adsorption capacity and affinity to the addition of lanthanide binding tags to the cell surface. The Tb stability constant with the LBT site is two orders of magnitude higher than that with the carboxyl functional group. As a result, at low metal loading <10 $\mu$M, the Tb binding to the cell surface of the LBT-strain is controlled by the presence of high-affinity, but lower capacity, LBT sites. At higher metal loadings >10 $\mu$M, a more abundant but low affinity functional group becomes the main source of adsorption that results in an overall higher sorption capacity. This work demonstrates how surface complexation modeling can be implemented for bacterial surfaces engineered with a known protein tag to optimize REE recovery from fluids with variable pH and metal loadings.}

      \field{abstract}{In this study, the biosorption kinetics of lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) ions on the biomass of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PU21 (Rip64) was investigated. Effects of environmental factors and growth conditions on the biosorption were studied. Efficiency of metal ion recovery from metal-loaded biomass and subsequent regeneration of the biosorbent were also determined. The results show that, at pH 5.5, the resting cells were able to uptake up to 110 mg Pb/g dry cell, and the inactivated cells can adsorb 70 mg Pb/g dry cell. Biomass of P. aeruginosa PU21 (Rip64) had lower adsorption capacities for Cu and Cd ions than for lead ions. The resting cells had the maximum uptake of 23 mg Cu/g dry cell (at pH 5.0) and had 58 mg Cd/g dry cell (at pH 6.0). The saturation uptake capacities of inactivated cells were 19 mg Cu/g dry cell (at pH 5.0) and 43 mg Cd/g dry cell (at pH 6.0). The resting cells held optimal Pb adsorption capacity at the early stationary phase, whereas the best uptake of cadmium was observed with the cells which were of exponential growth phase. The growth phase exhibited no effects on the adsorption of Cu, however. The increase in mercury concentration (from 0 to 50 mg Hg2+/litre) in the growth media did not significantly affect the adsorption capacities of Pb2+, Cu2+ and Cd2+. However, the saturation uptake capacity and metal-cell affinity tended to increase as pH increased, until metals precipitated as metal hydroxides when the pH exceeded some threshold values. Adjusting the pH value to about 2.0 resulted in 98, 98 and 82{\%} recovery of Pb, Cu and Cd, respectively. The biomass resulted from desorption processes was able to retain approximately 80{\%} of original adsorption capacity for Pb and Cu with four repeated adsorption and recovery runs. Regeneration of biomass appears to enhance the uptake capacity of Cd by nearly 35{\%} after four adsorption/desorption cycles.}

      \field{abstract}{A three-dimensional (3D), free-standing graphene foam was prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition on nickel-foam. The prepared graphene foam was found to consist of few-layered vertically-aligned graphene sheets with highly graphite structure. Owing to the 3D interconnected porous nanostructures, the graphene foam exhibited a high electrical conductivity of 125 S/cm and a large surface area of 625.4 cm 2 /g. For practical application, we prepared the graphene foam/epoxy composites showing a maximum conductivity of 196 S/m at 2.5 vol.{\%} filler loading, and a rather low percolation threshold of 0.18 vol.{\%}. Furthermore, the derived graphene oxide foam exhibited an excellent absorption capability (177.6 mg/g for As(V), 399.3 mg/g for Pb(II)) and recyclability (above 90{\%} removal efficiency after five cycles) for the removal of heavy metal ions. The present study reveals that the multifunctional graphene foam may broaden the graphene-based materials for the applications in electrically conductive composites and environmental cleanup. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.}

      \field{abstract}{In this study, raw and formaldehyde-modified Sargassum sp. are used for heavy metal removal. A series of experiments shows that the chemical modification by formaldehyde improves biosorption capacity by approximately 20{\%}. Solution pH plays an important role in the metal uptake. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis, the possible organic functional groups in the metal binding include carboxyl, ether, alcoholic, hydroxyl, and amino functional groups. A new model that includes a series of coordination reactions among a generalized functional group, alkaline earth metal ions and heavy metal ions, is developed for simulation of biosorption process. The model well describes the single- and multiple-species metal biosorption process under different conditions such as pH. The biosorption of heavy metals is due to the ion exchange between the heavy metals and alkaline earth metals and their adsorption onto the free sites of the seaweeds. Slightly more than half of the metal uptake is due to ion exchange. The metal affinity for the functional groups follows a descending order of lead > copper > alkaline earth metal. © 2006 American Chemical Society.}

      \field{abstract}{Biomass waste, mainly Corynebacterium glutamicum, is generated from large-scale lysine fermentation process. In this study, protonated C. glutamicum biomass was evaluated as a biosorbent for the removal of lead from synthetic wastewater. As Pb2+ were bound to the biomass, the solution pH deceased, indicating that protons in the biomass were exchanged with lead ions. The Corynebacterium biomass bound Pb2+ at up to 2.74 mmol g-1 at pH 5, where lead does not precipitate. Compared with other biosorbents and conventional sorbents, such as natural zeolite, activated carbon and synthetic ion exchange resin, the protonated C. glutamicum biomass was considered to be a useful biomaterial for lead biosorption.}

      \field{abstract}{The purpose of the present study was to determine the temperature dependence of slow adsorption and desorption kinetics of some chlorobenzenes, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a lab-contaminated and a field-contaminated sediment. The kinetics of desorption were measured by means of a technique in which Tenax TA beads are used as 'sink' for desorbed solute. A first-order kinetic model with three sediment compartments described the desorption of the test compounds from the sediments. Apart from a rapidly desorbing fraction, two sediment fractions were distinguished, one slowly desorbing with a rate constant of (1-4) x 10-3 h-1 and a very slowly desorbing one with rate constants approximately 10-50 times smaller. From temperature dependence studies, the activation enthalpies for slow desorption appeared to be 60-70 kJ mol-1 for both the lab-contaminated and the field-contaminated sediments; the values were approximately constant for all compounds studied. From adsorption studies at two temperatures, enthalpies of sorption to the slow sediment compartment appeared to be slightly negative. Because slow desorption is much faster at elevated temperatures, the measurement of high-temperature desorption kinetics can provide information on long-term desorption kinetics and, probably, on the feasibility of bioremediation of aged contaminants.}

      \field{abstract}{Ca-loaded Pelvetia canaliculata biomass was used to remove Pb2+ in aqueous solution from batch and continuous systems. The physicochemical characterization of algae Pelvetia particles by potentiometric titration and FTIR analysis has shown a gel structure with two major binding groups - carboxylic (2.8mmolg-1) and hydroxyl (0.8mmolg-1), with an affinity constant distribution for hydrogen ions well described by a Quasi-Gaussian distribution. Equilibrium adsorption (pH 3 and 5) and desorption (eluents: HNO3 and CaCl2) experiments were performed, showing that the biosorption mechanism was attributed to ion exchange among calcium, lead and hydrogen ions with stoichiometry 1:1 (Ca:Pb) and 1:2 (Ca:H and Pb:H). The uptake capacity of lead ions decreased with pH, suggesting that there is a competition between H+ and Pb2+ for the same binding sites. A mass action law for the ternary mixture was able to predict the equilibrium data, with the selectivity constants $\alpha$CaH=9±1 and $\alpha$CaPb=44±5, revealing a higher affinity of the biomass towards lead ions. Adsorption (initial solution pH 4.5 and 2.5) and desorption (0.3M HNO3) kinetics were performed in batch and continuous systems. A mass transfer model using the Nernst-Planck approximation for the ionic flux of each counter-ion was used for the prediction of the ions profiles in batch systems and packed bed columns. The intraparticle effective diffusion constants were determined as 3.73×10-7cm2s-1 for H+, 7.56×10-8cm2s-1 for Pb2+ and 6.37×10-8cm2s-1 for Ca2+. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Equlibrium sorption of the phosphoric acid modified rice husk was studied. The Physico-chemical properties of the modified rice husk were determined. The equilibrium sorption data were fitted into Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich (DRK) isotherms. Of the four adsorption isotherm, the R 2 value of Langmuir isotherm model was the highest. The maximum monolayer coverage (Q o) from Langmuir isotherm model was determined to be 101.01mg/g, the separation factor indicating a favourable sorption experiment is 0.133. Also from Freundlich Isotherm model, the sorption intensity (n) which indicates favourable sorption and the correlation value are 1.6 and 0,89 respectively. The heat of sorption process was estimated from Temkin Isotherm model to be 25.34J/mol and the mean free energy was estimated from DRK isotherm model to be 0.7KJ/mol which vividly proved that the adsorption experiment followed a physical process.}

      \field{abstract}{A mechanistic model has been developed to describe the equilibrium adsorption of copper cyanide species onto activated carbon. This model was based on the calculation of equilibrium between the various copper cyanide complexes in both the aqueous and carbon phases. Solution non-ideality was also incorporated, as changes in ionic strength have a significant effect on the copper cyanide speciation. The use of a theoretical equilibrium constant (i.e. a linear isotherm) was found to poorly describe the adsorption of Cu(CN)2- and Cu(CN)32-, but better results were obtained by using a Freundlich isotherm for both species. Despite this, there were significant deviations under conditions of higher free cyanide, and hence the model was updated to include a desorption reaction, which is a function of the free cyanide concentration, to account for the irreversibility. This new model was found to predict the copper loading over a wide range of copper and cyanide concentrations. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.}

INTERACTION OF IONS AND CELL WALL COMPONENTS Intro: M + L -> ML where K of rxn is dependent on activity coeffs of Km, Kl, Kml Ligands may be mono/bi/multidentate => attach to metal ions using 1/2/+ donor atoms Protons directly compete with ions for binding sites: M + HL -> ML + H. Eg amino acid ligand needs to be deprotonated before ion can bind to amino nitrogen. Alkali and acid treatment of intact cell walls liberate primary carbohydrtes. Metal accumulation capacity: mannan>chitin>glucan>intact cell wall Metal accumulation mainly through C-OH and C=O groups. Attached amine and phosphate groups in addition to other protein fractions increase binding capacity. Addition of ATPase uncoupling gent 2,4 dinitrophenol the role of vacuolar H+ - ATPase antiport system in uptake of cations could be determined. 3. ISOLATED VACUOLES Isolated yeast cell vacuoles accum heav met cations. Vacuoles had limited accumulation capacity -> related to size. Large cations had lower concs in vacuoles. Majority of removal within the first 30 min. ATPase inhibitor DNP did not have a strong effect on metal uptake. Vacuolar uptake exhibits characteristics similar to cellular uptake. Vacuole uptake: ATPase dependent H+/antiport system 4. ACCUMULATION AND INTERNALISATION OF METALS BY VIABLE YEAST CELLS Resitance and tolerance mechanisms: 1) impermeability of membrane 2) sequestration of metals -> binding or precipitates 3) Bioreduction/oxidation 4) Synthesis of intracellular metal binding proteins = metallothioniens 5) chelating agents: sidephores, phosphoglycoproteins, ferritin, ferridoxins and sequestration in cytoplasmicgranules in phosphate rich cells AIM OF THE STUDY: To monitor the effect of heavy metals on viable yeast cells over time wrt to deposition cites and plasma membrane integrity. 8. ENERAL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 8.1 Bioacccumulation Higher ambient metals, greater accum Affinity for and levels of accum decreased in mixed ion solns as opposed to single ion soln in yeast Metal uptake increases with alkalinity Initial yeast metal contact occurs on the wall, followed by internalisation then sequestration Intracellular metal ion deposition occurs in soluble cytostol and insolunble vacuolar fractions. Priamry site for intrac dep is vac with granular in cytostol. Intracellular ion profile effect => exchange of Na, Mg, K eluted from cell interior 10.

      \field{abstract}{Biosorption is an innovative technology used to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions. A wider application of this alternative process is strictly related to the understanding of the chemico-physical aspects involved, in order to optimize the operative conditions. Mechanistic models are the most useful tools used for understanding purposes, even if the empirical models are still widely applied for their simplicity. In this paper, two original models were used to represent the experimental data of copper and cadmium biosorption onto Sphaerotilus natans in different operative conditions of pH and biomass concentration. Both models can represent the effect of pH onto biosorption performances using two different approaches. The first model is empirical, based on the observation that the maximal specific metal uptake courses vs. pH presents a logistic pattern. The second model is based on the non-competitive mechanism between heavy metals and H+ protons. Both models can represent adequately the experimental data, but the non-competitive model also gives a realistic description of the mechanism operating in the system according to a preliminary biomass characterization. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{The present work evaluates the performance of the yeast Saccharomyces Cerevisiae to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions. The effect of pH, temperature, initial concentration, contact time, and biosorbent dosage on biosorption capacity is studied. Experiment results show that metal uptake is a rapid process at pH values (5.0–6.0), and the order of accumulated metal ions is Pb > Zn > Cr > Co > Cd > Cu. The biosorption process obeys Freundlich and the Langmuir adsorption isotherms. The kinetics of metal ions biosorption could be described by Lagergren and Ho models. Nitric acid with low concentration of 0.05 N is effective in desorbing the biosorbed metal ions. Sodium hydroxide solution of 0.2 M is effective in regenerating the yeast; the regenerated yeast could be used for at least six cycles of biosorption, without losing its metal removal capacity. Carboxyl, amine, and phosphate groups present in the yeast were found to be the main biosorption sites for metal ions.}

      \field{abstract}{This study quantifies metal adsorption onto cell wall surfaces of Bacillus subtilis by applying equilibrium thermodynamics to the specific chemical reactions that occur at the water-bacteria interface. We use acid/base titrations to determine deprotonation constants for the important surface functional groups, and we perform metal-bacteria adsorption experiments, using Cd, Cu, Pb, and Al, to yield site-specific stability constants for the important metal-bacteria surface complexes. The acid/base properties of the cell wall of B. subtilis can best be characterized by invoking three distinct types of surface organic acid functional groups, with pKa values of 4.82 ± 0.14, 6.9 ± 0.5, and 9.4 ± 0.6. These functional groups likely correspond to carboxyl, phosphate, and hydroxyl sites, respectively, that are displayed on the cell wall surface. The results of the metal adsorption experiments indicate that both the carboxyl sites and the phosphate sites contribute to metal uptake. The values of the log stability constants for metal-carboxyl surface complexes range from 3.4 for Cd, 4.2 for Pb, 4.3 for Cu, to 5.0 for Al. These results suggest that the stabilities of the metal-surface complexes are high enough for metal-bacterial interactions to affect metal mobilities in many aqueous systems, and this approach enables quantitative assessment of the effects of bacteria on metal mobilities.

      \field{abstract}{Adsorption of phenol in aqueous phase onto activated carbons (ACs) having different textural and surface properties has been considered. Six types of ACs were used: three were commercial, and three were obtained from Kraft lignin chemically activated with sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or ortho-phosphoric acid. The apparent surface areas of the commercial ACs varied from 620 to 1320 m2/g, while ACs made from lignin presented surface areas as high as 1300 m2/g and 2900 m2/g when prepared with H3PO4 and alkaline hydroxides, respectively; moreover, the highest proportion of microporosity was found for ACs derived from lignin. A kinetic study was carried out, showing that the phenol adsorption data may be correctly adjusted, for all the ACs tested, by an equation corresponding to a pseudo second-order chemical reaction. Freundlich, Langmuir and Tempkin equations were tested for modelling the adsorption isotherms at equilibrium, and it was concluded that Langmuir model fitted adequately the experimental data. However, Tempkin model fitted even better the adsorption data obtained with ACs derived from lignin activated with alkaline hydroxides, which are characterized by the highest number of surface groups. Remarkably high phenol adsorption capacities were found for the ACs prepared by activation of Kraft lignin with NaOH and KOH: 238 and 213 mg/g of AC, respectively. Finally, the adsorption of phenol was found to depend not only on the micropore volume, but also on the total amount of carbonyl and basic groups and on the ratio of acid to basic groups. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

      \field{abstract}{Biosorption is a physico-chemical and metabolically-independent process based on a variety of mechanisms including absorption, adsorption, ion exchange, surface complexation and precipitation. Biosorption processes are highly important in the environment and conventional biotreatment processes. As a branch of biotechnology, biosorption has been aimed at the removal or recovery of organic and inorganic substances from solution by biological material which can include living or dead microorganisms and their components, seaweeds, plant materials, industrial and agricultural wastes and natural residues. For decades biosorption has been heralded as a promising cost-effective clean-up biotechnology. Despite significant progress in our understanding of this complex phenomenon and a dramatic increase in publications in this research area, commercialization of biosorption technologies has been limited so far. This article summarizes existing knowledge on various aspects of the fundamentals and applications of biosorption and critically reviews the obstacles to commercial success and future perspectives. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Concern about environmental protection has increased over the years from a global viewpoint. To date, the prevalence of adsorption separation in the environmental chemistry remains an aesthetic attention and consideration abroad the nations, owning to its low initial cost, simplicity of design, ease of operation, insensitivity to toxic substances and complete removal of pollutants even from dilute solutions. With the renaissance of isotherms modeling, there has been a steadily growing interest in this research field. Confirming the assertion, this paper presents a state of art review of adsorption isotherms modeling, its fundamental characteristics and mathematical derivations. Moreover, the key advance of the error functions, its utilization principles together with the comparisons of linearized and non-linearized isotherm models have been highlighted and discussed. Conclusively, the expanding of the nonlinear isotherms represents a potentially viable and powerful tool, leading to the superior improvement in the area of adsorption science. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

      \field{abstract}{The environmental and microbiological factors that can influence heavy metal toxicity are discussed with a view to understanding the mechanisms of microbial metal tolerance. It is apparent that metal toxicity can be heavily influenced by environmental conditions. Binding of metals to organic materials, precipitation, complexation, and ionic interactions are all important phenomena that must be considered carefully in laboratory and field studies. It is also obvious that microbes possess a range of tolerance mechanisms, most featuring some kind of detoxification. Many of these detoxification mechanisms occur widely in the microbial world and are not only specific to microbes growing in metal-contaminated environments. © 1978 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper discusses the adsorption of copper ions Cu2+ from aqueous solutions onto cellulosic waste orange peel (CWOP).The adsorption process depends on solution pH, adsorbent dose, contact time, initial metal ions concentration and agitation speed. The adsorption kinetics were relatively fast and equilibrium was reached in 60 min. The adsorption equilibrium follows Freundlich adsorption isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacity value of the (CWOP) for copper ions was 63 mg/g. The thermodynamic study showed that the adsorption of copper ions onto (CWOP) is spontaneous and exothermic. The external mass transfer kinetic model was applied to the experimental results and provided reasonable overall volumetric mass transfer coefficients.}

      \field{abstract}{We have conducted acid-base potentiometric titrations and U(VI) sorption experiments using the Gram negative, facultatively anaerobic bacterium Shewanella putrefaciens. Results of reversed titration studies on live, inactive bacteria indicate that their pH-buffering properties result from the equilibrium ionization of three discrete populations of functional groups. Carboxyl (pKa = 5.16 ± 0.04), phosphoryl (pKa = 7.22 ± 0.15) and amine (pKa = 10.04 ± 0.67) groups most likely represent these three resolvable functionalities, based on their pKa values. Site densities for carboxyl, phosphoryl and amine groups on the bacterial surface were approximately 31.7 $\mu$mol sites/g bacteria (0.35 ± 0.02 sites/nm2). 8.95 $\mu$mol/g (0.11 ± 0.007 sites/nm2) and 38.0 $\mu$mol/g (0.42 ± 0.008 sites/nm2), respectively, based on an estimated bacterial specific surface area of 55 m2/g. Sorption experiments showed that U(VI) can reversibly complex with the bacterial surface in the pH 2-8 interval, with maximum adsorption occuring at a pH of {\~} 5. Sorption is not strongly sensitive to ionic strength (NaCl) in the range 0.02-0.10 M. The pH and ionic strength dependence of U(VI) sorption onto S. putrefaciens is similar to that measured for metal-oxide surfaces and Gram positive bacteria, and appears to be similarly governed by competitive speciation constraints. Measured U(VI) sorption is accounted for by using two separate adsorption reactions forming the surface complexes > COO-UO+2 and > PO4H-UO2(OH)2. Using S. putrefaciens as a model organism for dissimilatory metal-reducing Gram negative anaerobes, our results extend the applicability of geochemical speciation models to include bacteria that are capable of reductively solubilizing or precipitating a wide variety of environmentally and geologically important metals and metallic species. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

      \field{abstract}{The biosorption of different metals (Cu2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Ni2+ and Pb2+) was investigated using activated sludge. The optimum pH was 4 for Cd, Cu and Pb sorption and 5 for Ni and Zn. Biomass metal uptake clearly competed with protons present in the aqueous medium, making pH an important variable in the process. Protons consumed by biomass in control tests versus protons exchange in biosorption tests confirmed a maximum exchange between metal cations and protons at pH 2. The study of the influence of biomass concentration revealed that the amount of protons released from biomass increased with biomass concentration. This would confirm the hypothesis of ion exchange between both types of ions. The application of the Langmuir and Freundlich models showed a better fitting of experimental data to the first model. The maximum sorption uptake of the studied metals by the activated sludge showed the following decreasing order: Pb>Cu>Cd≥Zn>Ni. Desorption experiments showed that HCl was a good eluent for the five metals tested, particularly at low pH values (1 and 2). At pH 3 or 4 the desorption yield was significantly lower. However, its use did not allow the reuse of biomass in subsequent loading and unloading cycles. EDTA was also a good desorption agent, achieving the total recovery for the five metals tested at a concentration of 1 mM, with the advantage that biomass could be reused for three sorption-desorption cycles. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{A pseudo-second order rate equation describing the kinetics of sorption of divalent metal ions onto sphagnum moss peat at different initial metal ion concentrations and peat doses has been developed. The kinetics of sorption were followed based on the amounts of metal sorbed at various time intervals. Results show that sorption (chemical bonding) might be rate-limiting in the sorption of divalent metal ions onto peat during agitated batch contact time experiments. The rate constant, the equilibrium sorption capacity and the initial sorption rate were calculated. From these parameters, an empirical model for predicting the sorption capacity of metal ions sorbed was derived.}

      \field{abstract}{This study presents the effect of aqueous Pb(II) and nutrient concentrations on the Pb(II)-removal, biomass viability, active species identities, and population distribution of an industrial Pb(II) resistant microbial consortium. The studied consortium has previously shown to be highly effective at precipitating Pb(II) from solution. At all conditions tested (80 and 500 ppm Pb(II), and varying nutrients conditions) it was found that circa 50{\%} of Pb(II) was removed within the first 3 h, with the absence of any visual changes, followed by a slower rate of Pb(II) removal accompanied by the formation of a dark precipitate. The Pb(II) removal was found to be independent of microbial growth, while growth was observed dependent on the concentration of Pb(II), nutrients, and nitrates in the system. SEM analysis indicated viable bacilli embedded in precipitate. These findings indicate that precipitation occurs on the surface of the biomass as opposed to an internal excretion mechanism. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) results indicated Klebsiella pneumoniae as the active species responsible for Pb(II) bioprecipitation for both the 80 and 500 ppm isolated colonies, while a diverse population distribution of organisms was observed for the streak plate analyses. A quicker microbial generation rate was observed than what was expected for Klebsiella pneumoniae, indicating that the overall consortial population contributed to the growth rates observed. This study provided insights into the factors affecting Pb(II) bio-removal and bioprecipitation by the investigated industrially obtained consortium, thereby providing invaluable knowledge required for industrial application.}

      \field{abstract}{In this study, the Pb2+ biosorption potential of live and dead biosorbents of the hydrocarbondegrading strain Rhodococcus sp. HX-2 was analyzed. Optimal biosorption conditions were determined via single factor optimization, which were as follows: Temperature, 25°C; pH, 5.0, and biosorbent dose, 0.75 g L-1. A response surface software (Design Expert 10.0) was used to analyze optimal biosorption conditions. The biosorption data for live and dead biosorbents were suitable for the Freundlich model at a Pb2+ concentration of 200 mg L-1. At this same concentration, the maximum biosorption capacity was 88.74 mg g-1 (0.428 mmol g-1) for live biosorbents and 125.5 mg g-1 (0.606 mmol g-1) for dead biosorbents. Moreover, in comparison with the pseudo-first-order model, the pseudo-second-order model seemed better to depict the biosorption process. Dead biosorbents seemed to have lower binding strength than live biosorbents, showing a higher desorption capacity at pH 1.0. The order of influence of competitive metal ions on Pb2+ adsorption was Cu2+ > Cd2+ > Ni+. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy analyses revealed that several functional groups were involved in the biosorption process of dead biosorbents. Scanning electron microscopy showed that Pb2+ attached to the surface of dead biosorbents more readily than on the surface of live biosorbents, whereas transmission electron microscopy confirmed the transfer of biosorbed Pb2+ into the cells in the case of both live and dead biosorbents. It can thus be concluded that dead biosorbents are better than live biosorbents for Pb2+ biosorption, and they can accordingly be used for wastewater treatment.}

      \field{abstract}{The adsorption of metals onto biological surfaces was studied exemplified by municipal sludge particulates of the primary, the secondary, and the tertiary sludge types from four regional wastewater treatment plants. Major factors affecting the extent of metal adsorption including pH, DOM, total biomass, and total metal loading were studied. The acidity-basicity characteristics of the DOM, the metal ions (Lewis acids), and the surface of the sludge particulates make pH the most important parameter in metal adsorption. Change in pH can modify the speciation of the metal ions, the DOM, and the surface acidity of the sludge particulates and subsequently determines the degree of metal distribution between the aqueous phase and the sludge solids. Information on the acidity-basicity characteristics of the DOM and the sludge particulates are used to calculate the stability constant of metal ion-sludge complexes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{The potentiality of biosurfactant-producing bacterium Pseudomonas sp. LKS06 to remove Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions from aqueous solution was investigated in this study. The maximum biosorption capacity of Pseudomonas sp. LKS06 biomass for Cd(II) and Pb(II) was found to be 27.5 and 77.8mgg-1, respectively, at the optimum pH of 6.0. The process can be better explained by Langmuir-Freundlich dual isotherm model (R2>0.981) while the kinetic data was best described by using the pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R2>0.999). Both metal ions were successfully recovered from the bacterial biomass using 0.1M HNO3 with 90{\%} recovery and the biomass shows high stability in the experiment of regeneration. Scanning electron microscopic analysis demonstrates a conspicuous surface morphology change of the Cd(II)/Pb(II)-adsorbed biomass. The results of zeta potential measurement and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested the involvement of amine, carboxyl, phosphate and hydroxyl groups during the biosorption process. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the biomass of Pseudomonas sp. LKS06 can be evaluated as an alternative biosorbent to remove Cd(II) and Pb(II) ions from industrial wastewater. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.}

      \field{abstract}{A bias correction to the Akaike information criterion, AIC, is derived for regression and autoregressive time series models. The correction is of particular use when the sample size is small, or when the number of fitted parameters is a moderate to large fraction of the sample size. The corrected method, called AICC, is asymptotically efficient if the true model is infinite dimensional. Furthermore, when the true model is of finite dimension, AICC is found to provide better model order choices than any other asymptotically efficient method. Applications to nonstationary autoregressive and mixed autoregressive moving average time series models are also discussed. © 1989 Biometrika Trust.}

      \field{abstract}{Highly efficient low cost adsorbent was prepared from Raphia hookerie fruit epicarp. Characteristics of the prepared low cost adsorbent (RH) was established using scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area. RH was applied for Rhodamine B (RhB) uptake from aqueous solution. Equilibrium adsorption data were fitted using four isotherms and kinetic data tested with five kinetic models. The BET surface area obtained was 0.00351 m2/g; SEM reveals large pores that could enhance the uptake of large molecules. Freundlich isotherm best described the uptake of RhB onto RH, the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity (qmax) was 666.67 mg/g. Pseudo second order model best described the kinetics of adsorption process. Energy of adsorption (E) obtained from D-R isotherm suggests physical adsorption. Desorption efficiency follows the order H2O>HCl>CH3COOH. Cost analysis shows that RH is about 1143 times more economical when compared with commercial activated carbon.}

      \field{abstract}{Analytical isotherm equations such as Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms are widely used for modeling adsorption data. However, these isotherms are primarily useful for simulating data collected at a fixed pH value and cannot be easily adapted to simulate pH-dependent adsorption effects. Therefore, most adsorption studies currently use numerical surface-complexation models (SCMs), which are more complex and time consuming than traditional analytical isotherm models. In this work, we propose a new analytical isotherm model, identified as the modified Langmuir-Freundlich (MLF) isotherm, which can be used to simulate pH-dependent adsorption. The MLF isotherm uses a linear correlation between pH and affinity coefficient values. We validated the proposed MLF isotherm by predicting arsenic adsorption onto two different types of sorbents: pure goethite and goethite-coated sand. The MLF model gave good predictions for both experimental and surface complexation-model predicted datasets for these two sorbents. The proposed analytical isotherm framework can help reduce modeling complexity, model development time, and computational efforts. One of the limitations of the proposed method is that it is currently valid only for single-component systems. Furthermore, the model requires a system-specific pH. vs. affinity coefficient relation. Despite these limitations, the approach provides a promising analytical framework for simulating pH-dependent adsorption effects. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Lead (Pb) is one of the most widely present heavy and toxic metals in the environment. Application of Pb-resistant bacteria to biomineralize this toxic metal could be utilized in the Pb bioremediation process. In this study, 93 ureolytic bacteria were newly isolated from the soil of abandoned metal mines. Among the isolates, Enterobacter cloacae KJ-46 and KJ-47 were selected for subsequent studies. When the biomineral samples were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma, high removal rates (ca. 60{\%}) of Pb were observed, following 48h of incubation. Scanning electron microscopy showed PbCO3 precipitates with a diameter of approximately 5$\mu$m. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the presence of Pb along with carbon (C) and oxygen (O) within the PbCO3 crystals. The results demonstrated that application of the biomineralization process based on stimulation of urea hydrolysis could be possible and potentially useful for soil bioremediation applications.}

      \field{abstract}{Many models exist for describing the experimental results of batch adsorption which are used in research to study equilibrium, kinetics, and mechanisms of adsorption. In the process of statistically analyzing the experimental data, the adsorption literature contains errors that render the results unreliable. These errors include incorrect application of theoretical models and also incorrect application of statistical analysis. Some errors are so abundant in the adsorption literature that they have actually gained credibility and mistakenly taken for granted that these are sound scientific practices. This article highlights some common errors in adsorption data analysis that are frequently found in the literature and provides suggestions for more sound practices. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

      \field{abstract}{The study investigates the relationship between changes in physiological energetics of organisms and alterations of growth, development and reproduction of Daphnia magna. Groups of primiparous daphnids were subjected to 8-day exposures to the heavy metals cadmium and copper or to the cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). Energetic alterations were estimated from the measurement of oxygen consumption and feeding activity which was performed during the last 3 days of the exposure period and from the calculation of simplified carbon balances. The physiological effects were compared to effects on organismal growth and reproduction as obtained from 17-day exposure experiments. Toxicant exposure reduced weight and body length of daphnids indicating an impaired growth rate, but effects on total metabolic costs measured as weight-specific oxygen consumption could not be detected. Net carbon gain of individuals decreased in a concentration-dependent way for the tested chemicals reflecting effects on biomass of daphnids. In the case of cadmium and copper, reproduction (∑mx: number of offspring per female of age x born during the time interval x-1 to x, summarised over the entire exposure period) and the estimate for the intrinsic rate of natural increase, derived from the 17-day exposure-experiment, were affected at concentrations comparable to the effect levels as observed for growth. In the case of copper, the concentrations affecting growth and reproduction were close to the 17-day LC50 value. CTAB caused a reduction in body length of primiparous daphnids whereas a decrease in the reproductive performance was not apparent. In conclusion, the chemicals did not change metabolic costs of exposed daphnids as it would be expected as a consequence of resistance or repair mechanisms, however, they induced alterations of SFG, growth, reproduction and intrinsic rate of natural increase. These alterations were chemical-specific. The fact that toxicant-related effects on growth and reproduction could not be linked to an elevated metabolic rate of daphnids may indicate that demand side effects occurred early during exposure - before the start of respirometric measurements - or that effects on growth were caused by an altered energy uptake. The results illustrate the importance of trade-off processes in regulating the distribution of energy among growth and reproduction of daphnids. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.}

      \field{abstract}{Water is a source of life and regarded as the most essential of natural resources. Water covers most of our; however, approximately 98{\%} of this water is seawater and is unusable for drinking because of the high concentration of salt. About 2{\%} of the planet's water is fresh, but 1.6 {\%} is locked up in polar ice caps and glaciers. Another 0.36 {\%}is found underground in aquifers and wells. Therefore, only about 0.036{\%} of the planet's total water supply is accessible in lakes and rivers. WHO/UNICEF survey states that in 45 developing countries, women and children bear the primary responsibility for water collection in the vast majority (76{\%}) of households. This is time not spent working at an income-generating job, caring for family members, or attending school [1]. Furthermore, existing freshwater resources are gradually becoming polluted and unavailable due to human or industrial activities. The increasing contamination of freshwater systems with thousands of industrial and natural chemical compounds is one of the key environmental problems facing humanity worldwide [2]. The ever-increasing world populations and rapidly advancing industrialization is causing more demand than ever for the dwindling supply of water, which makes it precious in more and more countries. In some parts of the world, water is a crucial commodity. Recently, a paper published in Nature indicated that 80{\%} of the world's population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security [3]. A growing number of contaminants are entering water supplies from industrialization and human activity like heavy metals, dyes; pharmaceuticals; pesticides, fluoride, phenols, insecticides, pesticides and detergents. In the case of pharmaceuticals, personal care products, hormones, pesticides, and other chemical compounds that are released into the water supply. Unprecedented health hazards are coming to light that did not previously exist resulting in an increased need for additional legislature [2]. Many water pollutants remain to be addressed, due to rapid industrialization new chemical compounds are continuously being developed and brought to the market and sooner or later they will emerge into the aquatic systems. Additionally water borne pathogenic microorganisms are ubiquitous throughout the world. These pathogenic microorganisms enter waterways through untreated sewage, storm drains, septic tanks, runoff from farms, and from various industries, especially the tanning and meat packaging industries. Major sources of water pollution are showed in Figure 1.}

      \field{abstract}{A lead-resistant bacterial strain was isolated from coal mine dump and identified as Acinetobacter junii Pb1 on basis of 16S rRNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) gene sequencing. The minimum inhibitory concentration of lead for the strain was 16,000 mg l−1 and it showed antibiotic and multi metal resistance. In aqueous culture, at an initial lead (Pb(II)) concentration of 100 and 500 mg l−1, lead adsorption and accumulation by the isolate was 100 and 60{\%}, at pH 7 at 30 °C after 48 and 120 h, respectively. The two fractions of exopolysaccharide (EPS), loosely associated EPS (laEPS) and bound EPS (bEPS), and whole cells (devoid of EPS) showed high binding affinity towards Pb(II). The binding affinity of laEPS towards Pb(II) (1071 mg Pb g−1) was three times higher than that of bEPS (321.5 mg Pb g−1) and 6.5 times higher than that of whole cells (165 mg Pb g−1). The binding affinity of EPS and whole cells with Pb(II), reported in the current study, is considerably higher as compared to that reported in the literature, till date. SEM analysis, showed an increase in thickness of cells on exposure to Pb(II) and TEM analysis, revealed its accumulation (interior of cell) and its adsorption (with the external cell surface). The isolate was also found to be positive for indole acetic acid (IAA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase production which helps in promoting plant growth. Thus, this study provides a new understanding towards Pb(II) uptake by A. junii Pb1, highlighting its potential on the restoration of Pb(II) contaminated repositories.}

      \field{abstract}{According to the theory previously developed, gaseous molecules impinging on a solid or liquid surface do not in general rebound elastically from the surface, but condense on it, and are held or adsorbed on the surface by forces similar to those holding the atoms or group molecules of solid bodies. If these forces are weak the “life” of the adsorbed molecules on the surface is short, so that the number of molecules adsorbed at any time is relatively small. On the other hand, when the forces are strong the rate of evaporation of the molecules may be so slow that the surface becomes practically completely covered by a monomolecular layer of adsorbed molecules. In the present paper this theory is extended and is developed along quantitative lines. The theory requires that in typical cases of true adsorption the adsorbed film should not exceed one molecule in thickness. This is contrary to the usual viewpoint. The discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that nearly all investigators have worked with porous bodies in which the adsorbing surface is indeterminate or have used nearly saturated vapors so that condensation of liquid occurred in capillary spaces. Others have mistaken solution or absorption for true adsorption. © 1918, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{10 kinetic models are studied in detail and used after to model the adsorption kinetics of lead on an activated carbon. All the kinetics parameters are determined: coefficients of diffusion, rate constants and maximum lead adsorption, then, compared to the literature data. The data are better simulated by the nonlinear models in the order: simplified Elovich > Elovich > Bangham > pseudo order n > Boyd, Crank long times > pseudo order 2 > Crank > Weber and Morris > Langmuir, pseudo order 1 > pore volume and surface diffusion model by Leyva Ramos > simplified Crank short times. It is one of the first times that the kinetics of adsorption are fitted by the entire true Crank model. The kinetics of lead adsorption by the activated carbon are best described by the Elovich equation: Q=1/$\beta$Ln$\alpha$$\beta$t with $\alpha$ equal to 0.035 mg g-1 s-1 and $\beta$ to 0.134 g mg-1.}

      \field{abstract}{AR (apple residue) was used as an alternative and cheap material for binding metal ions due to the presence of carboxyl and phenolic functional groups. The binding capacity of copper, lead, and cadmium by AR was pH dependent. Carboxyl groups of AR were esterified by acidic methanol to determine the contribution of carboxyl groups to metal ions binding. The extent of esterification was determined by analyzing the amount of methanol released in the sample hydrolysates by gas chromatography. The effect of esterification on binding metal ions was investigated in batch experiments by unmodified and modified AR. All esterified AR showed significant decreases in binding copper, lead and cadmium. The loss in the capacity of metal ion binding was proportional to the extent of esterification. The capacity of metal binding decreased with increase in the concentration of methanol in the respective hydrolysates or the modified AR. The data indicate that carboxyl groups on AR play an important role in the metal ion binding.}

      \field{abstract}{Biochar produced by thermal decomposition of biomass under oxygen-limited conditions has received increasing attention as a cost-effective sorbent to treat metal-contaminated waters. However, there is a lack of information on the roles of different sorption mechanisms for different metals and recent development of biochar modification to enhance metal sorption capacity, which is critical for biochar field application. This review summarizes the characteristics of biochar (e.g., surface area, porosity, pH, surface charge, functional groups, and mineral components) and main mechanisms governing sorption of As, Cr, Cd, Pb, and Hg by biochar. Biochar properties vary considerably with feedstock material and pyrolysis temperature, with high temperature producing biochars with higher surface area, porosity, pH, and mineral contents, but less functional groups. Different mechanisms dominate sorption of As (complexation and electrostatic interactions), Cr (electrostatic interactions, reduction, and complexation), Cd and Pb (complexation, cation exchange, and precipitation), and Hg (complexation and reduction). Besides sorption mechanisms, recent advance in modifying biochar by loading with minerals, reductants, organic functional groups, and nanoparticles, and activation with alkali solution to enhance metal sorption capacity is discussed. Future research needs for field application of biochar include competitive sorption mechanisms of co-existing metals, biochar reuse, and cost reduction of biochar production.}

      \field{abstract}{In this study, immobilized Pseudomonas aeruginosa PU21 beads were used as an adsorbent for lead(II). Different weight percentages of chitosan were added to polyethylene glycol (PEG, 0.5 wt.{\%} in aqueous solution) and alginate (18 wt.{\%} in aqueous solution), and then blended or cross-linked using different concentrations of epichlorohydrin (ECH) to prepare beads of different sizes and increased mechanical strength. Before blending or cross-linking, different weight percentages of P. aeruginosa PU21 were added to increase lead(II) adsorption. Subsequently the optimized bead composition (concentration of ECH, percentages of chitosan and P. aeruginosa PU21) and the optimum adsorption conditions (agitation rate and pH in the aqueous solution) were ascertained. Finally, the optimized beads adsorbing lead(II) were regenerated by 0.1 M aqueous HCl solutions and the most effective desorption agitation rate was ascertained. The results indicate that the reuse of immobilized P. aeruginosa PU21 beads was feasible. In addition, the equilibrium adsorption, kinetics, changes in the thermodynamic properties of adsorption of lead(II) on optimized beads were also investigated. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

      \field{abstract}{The efficacies of extracting extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from aerobic, acidogenic and methanogenic sludges using EDTA, cation exchange resin and formaldehyde under various conditions were compared. Results show that formaldehye plus NaOH was most effective in extracting EPS for all sludges; only 1.1-1.2{\%} of DNA in the sludge samples were detected, suggesting the EPS extracted were not contaminated by intracellular substances. For each gram of volatile solids, formaldehyde-NaOH extracted 165, 179 and 102 mg of EPS from aerobic, acidogenic and methanogenic sludges, respectively. All EPS were mainly composed of carbohydrate, protein and humic substance, plus small quantities of uronic acid and DNA. Carbohydrate was predominant in the acidogenic sludge (62{\%} in the EPS extracted by formaldehyde-NaOH), whereas protein was predominant in the methanogenic sludge (41{\%}). Humic substance, which has often been overlooked, accounted for 30.6, 8.4 and 22.8{\%} of the extracted EPS from aerobic, acidogenic and methanogenic sludges, respectively. However, judging from EPS quantities estimated from confocal laser scanning microscopic observations, formaldehyde-NaOH extracted only a limited portion of EPS. Optimization of extraction procedures and/or development of a more effective extraction method are warranted. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Lead sorption capacity and mechanisms by sludge-derived biochar (SDBC) were investigated to determine if treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD) containing metals with SDBC is feasible. It was found that the biochar derived from pyrolysis treatment of sewage sludge could effectively remove Pb 2+ from acidic solution with the capacities of 16.11, 20.11, 24.80, and 30.88mgg -1 at initial pH 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Lead sorption processes were pseudo-second order kinetic and faster at a higher pH. Furthermore, the relative contribution of both inorganic mineral composition and organic functional groups of SDBC for Pb 2+ removal mechanisms, was quantitatively studied at pH 2-5. The results showed that Pb sorption primarily involved the coordination with organic hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups, which was 38.2-42.3{\%} of the total sorbed Pb varying with pH, as well as the coprecipitation or complex on mineral surfaces, which accounted for 57.7-61.8{\%} and led to a bulk of Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ release during sorption process. A new precipitate was solely observed on Pb-loaded SDBC as 5PbO·P 2 O 5 ·SiO 2 (lead phosphate silicate) at initial pH 5, confirmed by XRD and SEM-EDX. The coordination of Pb 2+ with carboxyl and hydroxyl functional groups was demonstrated by FT-IR, and the contribution of free carboxyl was significant, ranging from 26.1{\%} to 35.5{\%}. Results from this study may suggest that the application of SDBC is a feasible strategy for removing metal contaminants from acid solutions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{This study was undertaken to investigate biosorption kinetics and equilibria of lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) ions using the biomass of Enterobacter sp. J1 isolated from a local industry wastewater treatment plant. Efficiency of metal ion recovery from metal-loaded biomass to regenerate the biosorbent was also determined. The results show that Enterobacter sp. J1 was able to uptake over 50 mg of Pb per gram of dry cell, while having equilibrium adsorption capacities of 32.5 and 46.2 mg/g dry cell for Cu and Cd, respectively. In general, Langmuir and Freundlich models were able to describe biosorption isotherm fairly well, except that prediction of Pb adsorption was relatively poor with Langmuir model, suggesting a different mechanism for Pb biosorption. Adjusting the pH value to 3.0 led to nearly complete desorption of Cd from metal-loaded biomass, while over 90{\%} recovery of Pb and Cu ions was obtained at pH ≦ 2. After four repeated adsorption/desorption cycles, biomass of Enterobacter sp. J1 retained 75, 79 and 90{\%} of original capacity for adsorption of Pb, Cu and Cd, respectively, suggesting good reusability of the biosorbent. A combinative model was proposed to describe the kinetics of heavy-metal adsorption by Enterobacter sp. J1 and the model appeared to have an excellent prediction of the experimental data. The model simulation results also seemed to suggest that intracellular accumulation may occur during the uptake of Pb. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Results of extensive application of the 2-pK constant capacitance surface complexation model (CCM) to surface charge data of a range of minerals in 0.1 M electrolytes are summarized where the program FITEQL has simultaneously been used to study the interdependence of the involved optimized parameters. To illustrate representative results, surface complexation and goodness of fit parameters are given as a function of the capacitance value (C). For all (ca. 150) tested data sets, one of three patterns is observed, two of which do not allow a unique parameter set to be obtained. The results indicate that the optimized site density parameter is relatively insensitive to a wide variation of C; optimized site density is rather low in this range of (higher) C and tends toward maximum proton uptake in the respective data set which in turn will be close to sometimes experimentally observed saturation levels. At low and with further decreasing C a steep increase of site density may occur; in this case, $\Delta$pK(a) strongly increases after a $\Delta$pK(a) minimum. Alternatively at low C, $\Delta$pK(a) may continue to decrease and site density decreases simultaneously after a site density maximum. The observed patterns can be explained by the constraint of C on the electrostatic correction factor. Linear correlation coefficients (which are very useful parameters but do not receive much attention) show that in the region of low C, the optimized parameters become fully correlated, which finally causes nonconvergence in parameter optimization. In the region where the optimized site density is not significantly affected by a decrease in C the optimized parameters are more weakly correlated. When site concentration is co-optimized high correlation between adjustable parameters suggests that it is preferable to have an estimate for this parameter. Overall, it can be stated that substantial difficulties were observed in the effort to obtain unique (and thus meaningful) parameters for the CCM in about 60{\%} of the data sets treated.}

      \field{abstract}{The Curtobacterium sp. FM01 was isolated from farmland soils of northeast Iran and tested for eight heavy metals removal in aqueous solutions. The results showed that the metal removal ({\%}) values for Ni (II) and Pb (II) with FM01 were significantly superior to the corresponding values with other metals. Accordingly, further analyses were concerted on the removal of Ni (II) and Pb (II) from aqueous solution in batch mode using dead biomass of Curtobacterium sp. FM01. Basic parameters such as pH (3-7), initial metal ion concentration (0.125-0.5 mM), contact time (5-720 min), varying biomass concentration (1-30 mg) and temperature (10-50 °C), were evaluated to determine the best biosorption conditions. The biosorption data are fitted well by the Langmuir biosorption isotherms for Ni (II) and Pb (II). The maximum biosorption capacity was found to be 186.60 for Pb (II) and 140.99 mg g-1 for Ni (II). The biosorption process of Pb (II) onto the FM01 was followed second-order rate kinetics; however, kinetics of biosorption of Pb (II) followed both first- and second-order rate equations, indicating that the process involving the rate-controlling step is complex. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis was carried out to characterize involvement of the functional groups of FM01 in the metal ions biosorption. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) examination of metabolically active bacterial cells revealed surface morphological changed following metal ions biosorption. The observed electron-dense area on the cells is due to the presence of metal ions and contains the biosorbed ions. The study suggests that Curtobacterium sp. FM01 could be a promising candidate with a capacity to remove Ni (II) and Pb (II) from aqueous solutions.}

      \field{abstract}{Lead contamination in groundwater has raised serious health concerns. The traditional technologies available for lead removal are having several shortcomings. Hence, biosorption is considered as a potential eco-friendly alternative to the existing methods. In the present work, several ground water samples were collected from different lead contaminated regions of III and IV phase of Peenya industrial area from Bengaluru district of Karnataka, India. These ground water samples were used as a source to isolate bacteria with distinct morphological characteristics which were identified as Bacillus toyonensis SCE1, Bacillus anthracis SCE2, Acinetobacter baumannii SCE3, Bacillus toyonensis SCE4 and Bacillus toyonensis SCE5 that were tested for their biosorption properties. The interactive effect of initial lead concentration versus contact time was studied using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) while the biosorbent dosage was kept constant. The biosorption kinetics was investigated for the isolates and the results studies indicated that the biosorption charted pseudo-second order kinetic model and it provided the best fit for the bacterial species for lead biosorption.}

      \field{abstract}{In this chapter we introduce regression models, i.e., how to fit (regress) one, or more quantities, against each other through a functional relationship and estimate any unknown parameters that dictate this relationship. Questions of interest include: how to deal with samples affected by selection effects? How does a rich data structure influence the fitted parameters? And what about non-linear multiple-predictor fits, upper/lower limits, measurement errors of different amplitudes and an intrinsic variety in the studied populations, or an extra source of variability? A number of examples illustrate how to answer these questions and how to predict the value of an unavailable quantity by exploiting the existence of a trend with another, available, quantity.}

This book is written for biologists, not mathematical statisticians, and presents a practical approach to fitting curves with nonlinear regression. It explains how to choose a model, how to make sensible choices when using a nonlinear regression program, and how to interpret the results. It also helps you troubleshoot "bad" fits and explains how to compare models and data sets.}

Bioremediation has become a potential alternative to the existing technologies for the removal and/or recovery of toxic lead from waste waters before releasing it into natural water bodies for environmental safety. To our best knowledge, this is a first review presenting different mechanisms employed by lead resistant bacteria to resist high levels of lead and their applications in cost effective and eco-friendly ways of lead bioremediation and biomonitoring. Various lead resistant mechanisms employed by lead resistant bacteria includes efflux mechanism, extracellular sequestration, biosorption, precipitation, alteration in cell morphology, enhanced siderophore production and intracellular lead bioaccumulation. ©2013 Elsevier Inc.}

      \field{abstract}{This study was designed to combine surface complexation modelling of macroscopic adsorption data with X-ray Absorption Spectroscopic (XAS) measurements to identify lanthanide sorption sites on the bacterial surface. The adsorption of selected representatives for light (La and Nd), middle (Sm and Gd) and heavy (Er and Yb) lanthanides was measured as a function of pH, and biomass samples exposed to 4 mg/L lanthanide at pH 3.5 and 6 were analysed using XAS. Surface complexation modelling was consistent with the light lanthanides adsorbing to phosphate sites, whereas the adsorption of middle and heavy lanthanides could be modelled equally well by carboxyl and phosphate sites. The existence of such mixed mode coordination was confirmed by Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) analysis, which was also consistent with adsorption to phosphate sites at low pH, with secondary involvement of carboxyl sites at high adsorption density (high pH). Thus, the two approaches yield broadly consistent information with regard to surface site identity and lanthanide coordination environment. Furthermore, spectroscopic analysis suggests that coordination to phosphate sites is monodentate at the metal/biomass ratios used. Based on the best-fitting pKa site, we infer that the phosphate sites are located on N-acetylglucosamine phosphate, the most likely polymer on gram-negative cells with potential phosphate sites that deprotonate around neutral pH. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Thermodynamic parameters for proton and metal adsorption onto a gram-negative bacterium from the genus Enterobacteriaceae have been determined and compared with parameters for other strains of bacteria. Potentiometric titrations were used to determine the different types of sites present on bacterial cell walls. Stability constants for adsorption of Pb, Cu and Zn to specific sites were determined from batch adsorption experiments at varying pH with constant metal concentration. Titrations revealed 3 distinct acidic surface sites on the bacterial surface, with pK values of 4.3±0.2, 6.9±0.5 and 8.9±0.5, corresponding to carboxyl, phosphate and hydroxyl/amine groups, with surface densities of 5.0±0.7×10-4, 2.2±0.6×10-4 and 5.5±2.2×10-4 mol/g of dry bacteria. Only carboxyl and phosphate sites are involved in metal uptake, yielding the following intrinsic stability constants: Log Kcarboxyl: Zn = 3.3±0.1, Pb = 3.9±0.8, and Cu = 4.4±0.2, Log Kphosphoryl: Zn = 5.1±0.1 and Pb = 5.0±0.9. The deprotonation constants are similar to those of other strains of bacteria, while site densities are also within an order of magnitude of other strains. The similarities in surface chemistry and metal stability constants suggest that bacteria may be represented by a simple generic thermodynamic model for the purposes of modelling metal transport in natural environments. Comparison with oxide-coated sand shows that bacteria can attenuate some metals to much lower pH values. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}

Increasing the ionic strength of the solution to 0.5 M resulted in a decreased metal uptake to 80{\%}, 65{\%} and 70{\%} for Sr<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup> and Cs<sup>+</sup>, respectively. Approximately 68{\%} of the adsorbed fraction on cell surfaces was exchangeable (i.e., was desorbed under acidic conditions). Using surface complexation models and equilibrium modelling analysis, reaction sites on the cell walls of the cultures were determined to belong to the –COOH and –H<inf>2</inf>PO<inf>4</inf> groups (pK<inf>a</inf> = 4–5 and 7–8, respectively). The distribution of the isoelectric equilibrium points for cell surfaces was consistent with the composition and characteristics of the identified microbial species in the culture which was dominated by the Gram(+ve) Bacilli – Lysinicibacillus boronitolerans AB199591 – and biofloc-forming Gram(–ve) SRBs, such as Desulfomonile tiedgei AF418162, Syntrophobacter wolinii X70905, and Desulforhopalus vacuolatus L42613. The high exchangeable fraction on the cells and the higher removal rates under lower ionic strength indicates that metal binding was non-electrostatic which was consistent with outer-sphere complexation behaviour.}

      \field{abstract}{Complex factors have contributed to the decline of aquatic populations worldwide. Among these factors are intensification of agriculture, including the application of fertilizers and agents of crop protection, and loss of habitat. Various developmental abnormalities in natural populations of aquatic vertebrates have been documented, and agricultural pesticides are considered by many to be one of the important factors that cause such abnormalities. Amphibians may potentially be a target of environmental stressors and toxicants as a result of their biphasic life cycles and skin permeability. In this chapter, the role of oxidative stress in the teratogenic action of pesticides is reviewed and addressed, with special attention given to non-target aquatic organisms such as amphibians, fish, and invertebrates. The review of available literature indicates that many pesticides enhance oxidative stress in aquatic organisms, and such stress may be linked to developmental alterations, including reproductive effects, embryotoxicity, and/or teratogenicity.}

      \field{abstract}{A methodological approach for validation, optimization and lumping of mechanistic models for heavy metal sorption onto composite natural matrices is proposed. It follows a previously developed mechanistic model for biosorption onto olive pomace, based on potentiometric titrations and Cu, Pb and Cd sorption tests at different pH. This model assumes two main kinds of active sites (carboxylic and phenolic groups) and three surface complexation reactions among these sites and metallic species in solution. It is able to represent the biosorption of Cu, Cd and Pb according to a general-validity reaction scheme in both acid and basic pH ranges. The identification of the most significant contributions of surface complexes by model simulations, along with sensitivity analysis oriented towards a lumped model, assumes one kind of active site (carboxylic) and two complexation reactions occurring in the pH 3-5 range. Simultaneous regression of titration data, first derivative plot of titration, and sorption data according to this lumped model, allow an improvement of experimental data representation by using a reduced number of parameters (i.e. model discrimination by statistical analysis). Contributions of surface complexes and sensitivity analysis show that all the assumed reactions of this lumped model are significant and necessary to represent biosorption of Cu, Cd and Pb in pH range 3-5. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

      \field{abstract}{Oxidative stress has been implicated to play a role, at least in part, in pathogenesis of many disease conditions and toxicities in animals. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species and free radicals beyond the cells intrinsic capacity to neutralize following xenobiotics exposure leads to a state of oxidative stress and resultant damages of lipids, protein, and DNA. Lead and cadmium are the common environmental heavy metal pollutants and have widespread distribution. Both natural and anthropogenic sources including mining, smelting, and other industrial processes are responsible for human and animal exposure. These pollutants, many a times, are copollutants leading to concurrent exposure to living beings and resultant synergistic deleterious health effects. Several mechanisms have been explained for the damaging effects on the body system. Of late, oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the lead- and cadmium-induced pathotoxicity. Several ameliorative measures to counteract the oxidative damage to the body system aftermath or during exposure to these toxicants have been assessed with the use of antioxidants. The present review focuses on mechanism of lead- and cadmium-induced oxidate damages and the ameliorative measures to counteract the oxidative damage and pathotoxicity with the use of supplemented antioxidants for their beneficial effects. © 2011 R.

      \field{abstract}{The objective of the study was to determine the influence of elevated lead concentrations on the rates of lead precipitation by a local industrially-obtained consortium. The consortium was sourced from a lead battery recycling plant located in Gauteng, South Africa. The experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions using commercial Luria Bertani (LB) broth and simulated LB broth (reduced NaCl concentration) as the growth media. The respective media were spiked with various concentrations of lead, ranging from 80 ppm to 1000 ppm. All concentrations of lead resulted in a black precipitate with a final medium pH of between 6 and 8, indicating the presence of lead(0). A 99 {\%} removal of lead occurred with 500 ppm lead after 11 days. A lead concentration of 1000 ppm was reduced by 87 {\%} after 22 days. The higher NaCl concentration in the commercial LB broth formed a white precipitate (PbCl2) upon initiation of the high lead(II) concentration experiments. These experiments also presented with a black precipitate at a later stage, indicating that the lead in the PbCl2 precipitate remained available for reduction to elemental lead. No white precipitate was observed during experimentation where the simulated LB broth was used with a lower concentration of NaCl. The results indicate that the consortium precipitates lead concentrations up to 1000 ppm. This provides support that biological precipitation has potential application in industry for the hydrometallurgical processing of lead as well as industrial lead bioremediation.}

      \field{abstract}{Micrococcus luteus DE2008 has the ability to absorb lead and copper. The effect of these metals on biomass and viability of this microorganism were investigated and removal of the metals from culture media was determined. Lead had no effect on the biomass expressed as mg Carbon/cm3 of M. Iuteus DE2008, but in the case of copper, the minimum metal concentration that affected the biomass was 0.1 mM Cu(II). According to these results this microorganism shows a greater tolerance for lead. The minimum metal concentration that affected viability (expressed as the percentage of live cells) was 0.5 mM for both metals. M. luteus DE2008 exhibited a specific removal capacity of 408 mg/g for copper and 1965 mg/g for lead. This microorganism has a greater ability to absorb Pb(II) than Cu(II). M. luteus DE2008 could be seen as a microorganism capable of restoring environments polluted by lead and copper.}

      \field{abstract}{For decades, a vast array of innovative biosorbents have been found out and used in the removal of heavy metals, including bacteria, algae and fungi, etc. Although extensive biological species have been tried as a biosorbent for heavy metals removal, for removal efficiency or economy efficiency limited, it has failed to make a substantial breakthrough in practical application. Thus, many improved methods based on biosorbents emerged. In this review, based on the literature and our research results, we highlight three types of novel methods for biosorbents removal of heavy metals: chemical modification of biosorbents; biomass and chemical materials combination; multiple biomass complex systems. We mainly focus on their configuration, biosorption performance, their creation method, regeneration/reuse, their application and development in the future. Through the comparative analysis of various methods, we think that intracellular autogenous nanomaterials may open up another window in biosorption of heavy metals area. At the same time, the combination of various treatment methods will be the development tendency of heavy metal pollution treatment in the future.}

      \field{abstract}{A study has been made of the kinetics of sodium-hydrogen exchange on sulfonated cross-linked polystyrenes in bead form. Resins of 5 and 17{\%} (nominal) divinylbenzene content were fractionated by wet elutriation and matched according to swollen particle diameter. The rates of exchange were measured by an “indicator” method. For both resins, the kinetics at high sodium ion concentrations in solution (<1 N) are clearly distinct from those at low concentrations (<0.05 N). At high concentrations, the rate is independent of the sodium ion concentration and inversely proportional to the square of the particle radius. At low concentrations, the rate is proportional to the sodium ion concentration and inversely proportional to the particle radius. These results support the view that at low concentrations, the rate is controlled by “film” diffusion, and at high concentrations by “particle” diffusion. Equations of the type derived by Boyd, Adamson and Myers on the basis of these mechanisms are obeyed. In further confirmation, when close fractions of the same mean particle diameter were compared it was found that the two resins exchange initially at the same rate per particle at low concentrations (film diffusion) but at markedly different rates at high concentrations (particle diffusion). © 1953, American Chemical Society.

      \field{abstract}{During the long and cold winter season in northern area of China, wastewater treatment is often inefficient which causes the substandard discharge. In this study, a lead-resistant psychrotrophilic bacterium was isolated and used as an adsorbent to remove Pb(II) from aqueous solution at 15°C. The strain was identified and designated as Bacillus sp. PZ-1 based on the morphology, physiological-biochemical experiments and 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The minimal inhibitory concentration and antibiotic experiments revealed that PZ-1 had high resistance to 1500mgL<sup>-1</sup> of Zn(II), 800mgL<sup>-1</sup> of Cu(II), 400mgL<sup>-1</sup> of Ni(II), 15$\mu$gmL<sup>-1</sup> of chloramphenicol and 50$\mu$gmL<sup>-1</sup> of streptomycin, but susceptibility to 200mgL<sup>-1</sup> of Co(II). Scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy analyses showed that biosorption of Bacillus sp. PZ-1 to Pb(II) involved surface adsorption, ion exchange and micro-precipitate. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses indicated that hydroxyl, carbonyl and carboxyl on cells may play vital roles in Pb(II) adsorption. Besides, siderophore secreted by PZ-1 had beneficial impacts on the Pb(II) removal. Biosorption experiments were carried out as a function of initial Pb(II) concentration (50-500mgL<sup>-1</sup>), pH (3.0-7.0), biomass concentration (5-50gL<sup>-1</sup>) and contact time (5-40min). Biosorption rate of 93.01{\%} with adsorption capacity of 9.30mgg<sup>-1</sup> was obtained under the initial Pb(II) concentration of 400mgL<sup>-1</sup>, pH of 5.0, contact time of 20min, biomass concentration of 40gL<sup>-1</sup> and the temperature of 15°C. The equilibrium data were well fitted with Langmuir model, which indicated the adsorption process of Pb(II) is monolayer adsorption. Bacillus sp. PZ-1 appeared to be an efficient biosorbent for removing Pb(II) from wastewater at low temperature.}

      \field{abstract}{Thousands of articles have been devoted to examine different types of biosorbents and their use in cleaning polluted waters. An important objective of some studies has been the identification of the biosorption mechanisms. This type of investigation is not always performed, as it can only be done if scientists are aware of all mechanisms that, at least theoretically, control the removal of the target substances. Mistakes are often made, even in highly cited review articles, where biosorption mechanisms are named and/or grouped. The aim of this article is to highlight errors and inaccuracies as well as to discuss different classification systems of the biosorption mechanisms. This article serves as a guide, as well as a platform for discussion among researchers involved in the investigation of biosorbents, in an effort to avoid reproducing errors in subsequent articles.}

      \field{abstract}{Taro (Colocasiaesculenta(L.) Schott) was studied as a biosorbent to remove lead(II) from water. The biosorbent was characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray measurements (EDX), Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) technique. Its structural and morphological characterizations indicate that it has potent adsorptive functional groups, high surface area (20.8 m2 ·g-1), flaky stratified structure and huge porosity (pore size: 0.80 nm, pore volume: 0.006 cm3 ·g-1). Optimum biosorption occurred at pH 5.5-7.00 with a particle size of 0.150 mm and the maximum adsorption capacity of Pb(II) was 291.56 mg ·g-1. The effective biosorption dose was estimated to be 0.9 g ·L-1. The ion exchange mechanism is primarily a biosorption process. The biosorption exhibited a high tolerance towards various other ions. The study of Langmuir, Freundlich and Tempkin isotherms implied the involvement of a complex biosorption process. The biosorption followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model with significantly fast rate and the intra-particle-diffusion-process was the prime rate-controlling factor. For 100 mg Taro, the regeneration was carried out using 5 mL of 0.1 M nitric acid as an eluent and five times regenerated Taro could be efficiently reused. The biosorbent along with developed biosorption procedure was successfully applied to remove Pb(II) from river water.}

      \field{abstract}{This paper deals with adsorption of Pb, Cu and Zn on the polysaccharide produced by Bacillus firmus. The adsorption of metal ions was significantly affected by the initial pH of solution, initial metal ion and polysaccharide concentrations, and presence of other ions in solution. At optimum pH, the uptakes of Pb, Cu and Zn were 98.3{\%}, 74.9{\%} and 61.8{\%}, respectively. The metal ions removal was lower at neutral and generally the initial adsorption rate was rapid and reached equilibrium after 10min. The process of uptake obeys both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{The lead biosorption capacity of a Streptomyces rimosus biomass treated with NaOH (0.1 M) was studied in the batch mode. After pretreatment of biomass at the ambient temperature, optimum conditions of biosorption were found to be: a biomass particle size between 50 and 160 $\mu$m, an average contact time of 3 h, a biomass concentration of 3 g/l and a stirring speed of 250 rpm. The equilibrium data could be fitted by Langmuir isotherm equation. Under these optimal conditions, 135 mg Pb2+/g biomass was obtained. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Titration method has been applied for both qualification and quantification of the surface functional groups of carbon materials. In this method, the number of the specific functional groups such as carboxylic, lactonic, and phenolic groups is established using the selective neutralization principles. In this chapter, the basic concept for easy understanding of the titration method is introduced and then the experiment and analysis techniques of the titration for determination of the degree of functionalization of carbon materials are provided.}

      \field{abstract}{In recent years, adsorption science and technology for water and wastewater treatment has attracted substantial attention from the scientific community. However, the number of publications containing inconsistent concepts is increasing. Many publications either reiterate previously discussed mistakes or create new mistakes. The inconsistencies are reflected by the increasing publication of certain types of article in this field, including “short communications”, “discussions”, “critical reviews”, “comments”, “letters to the editor”, and “correspondence (comment/rebuttal)”. This article aims to discuss (1) the inaccurate use of technical terms, (2) the problem associated with quantities for measuring adsorption performance, (3) the important roles of the adsorbate and adsorbent pKa, (4) mistakes related to the study of adsorption kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics, (5) several problems related to adsorption mechanisms, (6) inconsistent data points in experimental data and model fitting, (7) mistakes in measuring the specific surface area of an adsorbent, and (8) other mistakes found in the literature. Furthermore, correct expressions and original citations of the relevant models (i.e., adsorption kinetics and isotherms) are provided. The authors hope that this work will be helpful for readers, researchers, reviewers, and editors who are interested in the field of adsorption studies.}

      \field{abstract}{In this work single and four-component adsorption kinetics was studied for removal of Pb 2+, Cd 2+, Cu 2+ and Zn 2+ from aqueous solutions with activated carbon from apricot stones. The adsorption equilibrium was calculated by the Langmuir model for single- and multi-component systems. Comparison of three kinetic models for internal diffusion control was performed. The steep initial part of the kinetic curve was accounted for by an intercept term in the linear representation of the models of Weber and Morris, Boyd and the moment method. The Weber and Morris model was found to correlate best with the experimental data. The intraparticle diffusion coefficients for the individual ions are in the range 1-3 × 10 -8cm 2/s. Similar results were obtained by the moment method applied to homogeneous solid phase diffusion control. Lower values of the kinetic parameters were obtained in four-component solutions. The calculated summary diffusion coefficient in the multi-component system is close to that obtained for single-component solutions with the same total initial ion concentration. © 2011 Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Union of Chemists in Bulgaria.}

      \field{abstract}{Biosorption of Pb(II) and Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions has been studied in a batch system by using a bacterial strain isolated from metal polluted soil. The bacterial strain was identified as Bacillus sp. The optimum conditions of biosorption were determined by investigating the initial pH, contact time and the initial concentrations of metal ions at constant temperature (25 °C). The maximum biosorption of the metal ions was observed at pH 3.0 ± 0.1 for Pb(II) and pH 5.0 ± 0.1 for Cu(II) ions. Biosorption equilibrium times for Pb(II) and Cu(II) ions were observed in 15 and 30 min, respectively. The maximum biosorption capacities of Pb(II) and Cu(II) ions on Bacillus sp. were determined to be 92.27 ± 1.17 mg g-1 at 250 mg l-1 concentration and 16.25 ± 1.64 mg g -1 at 200 mg l-1 concentration, respectively. The experimental adsorption data were fitted to Langmuir isotherm model. Competition of metal ions during biosorption was investigated in binary metal solutions. The interactions between metal ions and functional groups on the cell wall surface of the biomass were confirmed by FTIR, SEM and EDAX analysis. The results indicated that bacterial isolate Bacillus sp. is a suitable biosorbent for the removal of Pb(II) and Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions.}

      \field{abstract}{Modeling of adsorption processes is vital especially in water treatment processes. To ensure that the right adsorbent is used to remove the target pollutant in water with good efficiency, at the right rate and in the right conditions, mathematical models are employed. Furthermore, these models provide valuable data that are useful in developing an adsorption reactor for large-scale adsorption purposes. Several authors have used these models for providing information about their adsorbents or their adsorption system without any deep understanding of these models. This chapter provides a detailed insight into these mathematical models, their theories and assumptions, and how they are effectively used to provide the needed information that is useful to the scientists and the engineers. This chapter did not consider exactly every mathematical model used for estimating adsorption process. However, it takes into consideration fundamental models and their applications. It is hoped that this chapter provides the scientists and engineers a better understanding of these adsorption models and even those that will be developed in the future.}

      \field{abstract}{The biosorption of lead (II) and copper (II) ions, single component and binary systems, by dried P. putida was investigated in a batch system. The effects of initial pH, temperature, initial single and binary mixture concentrations on the biosorption kinetics and equilibrium uptake of each component, both single and binary mixtures were investigated. The bacterial biomass exhibited the highest single and binary lead (II) and copper (II) ions uptake capacity at 25 and 30 °C, respectively, the initial pH value of 5.5 and at the initial metal ions concentration of 100 mg dm-3. The Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption models were used for the mathematical description of the biosorption equilibrium and isotherm constants were evaluated at different temperatures. Adsorption data were well described by the Langmuir model, although they could be modeled by the Freundlich equation. The thermodynamics constants of the adsorption process: $\Delta$H°, $\Delta$S° and $\Delta$G° were evaluated. The results showed that biosorption of single and binary lead (II) ions on P. putida were exothermic and spontaneous. While biosorption of single and binary copper (II) ions on P. putida was endothermic and spontaneous. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{A study on the biosorption of toxic metals (copper, manganese, nickel and lead) by a species of Arthrobacter is presented. The equilibrium of the process was in all cases well described by the Langmuir isotherm. The highest values of specific uptake were 406 mg Mn/g, 148 mg Cu/g, 13 mg Ni/g and 130 mg Pb/g. Some factorial experiments were performed in order to investigate the effect of operating and cultural conditions on the equilibrium. Experimental results showed the influence of the biomass concentration on the specific uptake (mg of metal/g biomass as dry weight). A comparison with results reported in the literature was made.}

      \field{abstract}{The removal of Pb+2 ions by Sargassum filipendula was studied using batch process. The biosorbent characterization was carried out by FESEM-EDX and FTIR techniques. Central composite design was used to optimize Pb+2 ions biosorption process by varying four different independent process parameters (temperature, pH, biosorbent dosage, and initial concentration of Pb+2 ions). The adequacy of response surface model was checked by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The optimum process parameters for the removal of Pb+2 ions were found as temperature (34.8°C), pH (4.99), initial concentration (152.10mg/L) and biosorbent dosage (0.49g/L) at which 96{\%} of removal were achieved. The predictive capabilities of six types of kinetic models and six types of adsorption isotherm models were examined for S. filipendula. For this study, Fritz isotherm model and Bangham kinetic model were found as best fitted models for the biosorption of Pb+2 ions. Desorption studies showed that after four consecutive biosorption-desorption cycles 77.53{\%} and 90.84{\%} of desorption and biosorption efficiency were achieved, respectively. The studied thermodynamic parameters showed that biosorption of Pb+2 ions on S. filipendula were feasible, spontaneous, and endothermic in nature. Thus, in view of experimental observations it can be concluded that S. filipendula can be used as an efficient biosorbent for Pb+2 ions biosorption from the aqueous solution.}

      \field{abstract}{Biosorption is a technique that can be used for the removal of pollutants from waters, especially those that are not easily biodegradable such as metals and dyes. A variety of biomaterials are known to bind these pollutants, including bacteria, fungi, algae, and industrial and agricultural wastes. In this review, the biosorption abilities of bacterial biomass towards dyes and metal ions are emphasized. The properties of the cell wall constituents, such as peptidoglycan, and the role of functional groups, such as carboxyl, amine and phosphonate, are discussed on the basis of their biosorption potentials. The binding mechanisms, as well as the parameters influencing the passive uptake of pollutants, are analyzed. A detailed description of isotherm and kinetic models and the importance of mechanistic modeling are presented. A systematic comparison of literature, based on the metal/dye binding capacity of bacterial biomass under different conditions, is also provided. To enhance biosorption capacity, biomass modifications through chemical methods and genetic engineering are discussed. The problems associated with microbial biosorption are analyzed, and suitable remedies discussed. For the continuous treatment of effluents, an up-flow packed column configuration is suggested and the factors influencing its performance are discussed. The present review also highlights the necessity for the examination of biosorbents within real situations, as competition between solutes and water quality may affect the biosorption performance. Thus, this article reviews the achievements and current status of biosorption technology, and hopes to provide insights into this research frontier. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}

      \field{abstract}{Biosorption has been defined as the property of certain biomolecules (or types of biomass) to bind and concentrate selected ions or other molecules from aqueous solutions. As opposed to a much more complex phenomenon of bioaccumulation based on active metabolic transport, biosorptioVolesky, B. (2007). Biosorption and me. Water Research, 41(18), 4017–4029. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2007.05.062n by dead biomass (or by some molecules and/or their active groups) is passive and based mainly on the "affinity" between the (bio-)sorbent and sorbate. A personal overview of the field and its origins is given here, focusing on R{\&}D reasoning and know-how that is not normally published in the scientific literature. While biosorption of heavy metals has become a popular environmentally driven research topic, it represents only one particular type of a concentration-removal aspect of the sorption process. The methodology of studying biosorption is based on an interdisciplinary approach to it, whereby the phenomenon can be studied, examined and analyzed from different angles and perspectives-by chemists, (micro-)biologists as well as (process) engineers. A pragmatic science approach directs us towards the ultimate application of the phenomenon when reasonably well understood. Considering the variety of parameters affecting the biosorption performance, we have to avoid the endless empirical and, indeed, alchemistic approach to elucidating and optimizing the phenomenon-and this is where the power of computers becomes most useful. This is all still in the domain of science-or "directed curiosity". When the knowledge of biosorption is adequate, it is time to use it-applications of certain types of biosorption are on the horizon, inviting the "new technology" enterprise ventures and presenting new and quite different challenges. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

      \field{abstract}{A vast array of biological materials, especially bacteria, algae, yeasts and fungi have received increasing attention for heavy metal removal and recovery due to their good performance, low cost and large available quantities. The biosorbent, unlike mono functional ion exchange resins, contains variety of functional sites including carboxyl, imidazole, sulphydryl, amino, phosphate, sulfate, thioether, phenol, carbonyl, amide and hydroxyl moieties. Biosorbents are cheaper, more effective alternatives for the removal of metallic elements, especially heavy metals from aqueous solution. In this paper, based on the literatures and our research results, the biosorbents widely used for heavy metal removal were reviewed, mainly focusing on their cellular structure, biosorption performance, their pretreatment, modification, regeneration/reuse, modeling of biosorption (isotherm and kinetic models), the development of novel biosorbents, their evaluation, potential application and future. The pretreatment and modification of biosorbents aiming to improve their sorption capacity was introduced and evaluated. Molecular biotechnology is a potent tool to elucidate the mechanisms at molecular level, and to construct engineered organisms with higher biosorption capacity and selectivity for the objective metal ions. The potential application of biosorption and biosorbents was discussed. Although the biosorption application is facing the great challenge, there are two trends for the development of the biosorption process for metal removal. One trend is to use hybrid technology for pollutants removal, especially using living cells. Another trend is to develop the commercial biosorbents using immobilization technology, and to improve the biosorption process including regeneration/reuse, making the biosorbents just like a kind of ion exchange resin, as well as to exploit the market with great endeavor. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

      \field{abstract}{Adsorption technology has been widely applied in water and wastewater treatment, due to its low cost and high efficiency. The adsorption kinetic models have been used to evaluate the performance of the adsorbent and to investigate the adsorption mass transfer mechanisms. However, the physical meanings and the solving methods of the kinetic models have not been well established. The proper interpretation of the physical meanings and the standard solving methods for the adsorption kinetic models are very important for the applications of the kinetic models. This paper mainly focused on the physical meanings, applications, as well as the solving methods of 16 adsorption kinetic models. Firstly, the mathematical derivations, physical meanings and applications of the adsorption reaction models, the empirical models, the diffusion models, and the models for adsorption onto active sites were analyzed and discussed in detail. Secondly, the model validity evaluation equations were summarized based on literature. Thirdly, a convenient user interface (UI) for solving the kinetic models was developed based on Excel software and provided in supplementary information, which is helpful for readers to simulate the adsorption kinetic process.}

      \field{abstract}{Competitive adsorption of heavy metals by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) extracted from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans was investigated. Chemical analysis showed that different EPS compositions had different capacities for the adsorption of heavy metals which was investigated using Cu2+ and Zn2+. Batch adsorption tests indicated that EPS had a higher combined ability with Zn2+ than Cu2+. This was confirmed and explained by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy analysis. FTIR analysis showed that both polysaccharides and protein combined with Zn2+ while only protein combined with Cu2+. EEM spectra further revealed that tryptophan-like substances were the main compositions reacted with the heavy metals. Moreover, Zn2+ had a higher fluorescence quenching ability than Cu2+. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{The Elovich equation has been widely used in adsorption kinetics, which describes chemical adsorption (chemical reaction) mechanism in nature. The approaching equilibrium parameter of Elovich equation (RE) was used here to describe the characteristic curves of adsorption kinetics. Of 64 adsorption systems surveyed in this work, 80{\%} of the RE values were between 0.1 and 0.3 with an adsorption curve belonging to "mild rising". The results of three examples revealed that the characteristic curve of Elovich equation was between those of Lagergren's first-order equation and intraparticle diffusion model. Chitosans prepared from prawn, lobster, and crab shells were used for the adsorption of a reactive dye. The mean deviation obtained from the three kinetic models revealed that Elovich equation was the most suitable one. All the adsorption systems were in the "mild rising" zone. The RE value was related to the type of raw material but not to the particle size of chitosan, which agreed with chemical adsorption nature of the Elovich equation. According to an optimal adsorbent consumption of 85{\%} coupled with its corresponding operating time (t0.85) proposed, these two parameters could be used for engineering design. © 2009.}

      \field{abstract}{The sorption of Pb and Cd from aqueous solutions by spent Agaricus bisporus was investigated. The effects of contact time, pH, ionic medium, initial metal concentration, other metal ions presence and ligands were studied in batch experiments at 25°C. Maximum sorption for both metals was found to occur at an initial pH of around 5.5. The equilibrium process was well described by the Langmuir isotherm model, with maximum sorption capacities of 0.2345 and 0.1273mmolg-1 for Pb and Cd respectively. Kinetic data followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The presence of NaCl and NaClO4 caused a reduction in Cd sorption, while Pb sorption was not remarkably affected. The presence of other metals did not affect Pb removal, while the Cd removal was much reduced. HCl or EDTA solutions were able to desorb Cd from the spent Agaricus bisporus (SAB) completely, while an approximately 60{\%} and 15{\%} desorption yield was obtained for Pb when HCl 0.01molL-1 or EDTA 0.001molL-1 were used, respectively. The results of FTIR, SEM and EDX analysis indicated that other mechanisms, such as surface complexation and electrostatic interactions, must be involved in the metal sorption in addition to ion exchange. © 2012 Canadian Society for Chemical Engineering.}

      \field{abstract}{Biosorption of uranium metal ions by a nonliving protonated Sargassum fluitans seaweed biomass was used to remove the heavy metal uranium from the aqueous solution. Uranium biosorption isotherms were established for solution pH values ranging from pH 2.5-4.0. Uranium biosorption uptake was accompanied by the release of protons from the biomass. The sorption isotherms were highly pH dependent, and the metal binding increased significantly with increasing pH values. Above pH 3.0, the maximum uranium uptakes exceeded the total biomass binding capacity as expressed in equivalents units. A mathematical model based on the ion exchange between proton in the biomass and hydrolyzed uranium ion species was developed. Given the total uranium concentration and pH value, the model can calculate the uranium and proton binding as well as the composition of uranium ionic groups in the solution and on the biosorbent. The model was capable of fitting and predicting biosorption isotherms for different pH values as well as the equilibrium uranium desorption concentrations.}

      \field{abstract}{Carbon-based adsorbents such as graphene and its derivatives, carbon nanotubes, activated carbon, and biochar are often used to remove heavy metals from aqueous solutions. One of the important aspects of effective carbon adsorbents for heavy metals is their tunable surface functional groups. To promote the applications of functionalized carbon adsorbents in heavy metal removal, a systematic documentation of their syntheses and interactions with metals in aqueous solution is crucial. This work provides a comprehensive review of recent research on various carbon adsorbents in terms of their surface functional groups and the associated removal behaviors and performances to heavy metals in aqueous solutions. The governing removal mechanisms of carbon adsorbents to aqueous heavy metals are first outlined with a special focus on the roles of surface functional groups. It then summarizes and categorizes various synthesis methods that are commonly used to introduce heteroatoms, primarily oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, onto carbon surfaces for enhanced surface functionalities and sorptive properties to heavy metals in aqueous solutions. After that, the effects of various functional groups on adsorption behaviors of heavy metals onto the functionalized carbon adsorbents are elucidated. A perspective of future work on functional carbon adsorbents for heavy metal removal as well as other potential applications is also presented at the end.}

      \field{abstract}{Heavy metal (HM) is a major hazard to the soil-plant system. This study investigated the combined effects of cadium (Cd), zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) on activities of four enzymes in soil, including calatase, urease, invertase and akalin phosphatase. HM content in tops of canola and four enzymes activities in soil were analyzed at two months after the metal additions to the soil. Pb was not significantly inhibitory than the other heavy metals for the four enzyme activities and was shown to have a protective role on calatase activity in the combined presence of Cd, Zn and Pb; whereas Cd significantly inhibited the four enzyme activities, and Zn only inhibited urease and calatase activities. The inhibiting effect of Cd and Zn on urease and calatase activities can be intensified significantly by the additions of Zn and Cd. There was a negative synergistic inhibitory effect of Cd and Zn on the two enzymes in the presence of Cd, Zn and Pb. The urease activity was inhibited more by the HM combinations than by the metals alone and reduced approximately 20{\%}-40{\%} of urease activity. The intertase and alkaline phosphatase activities significantly decreased only with the increase of Cd concentration in the soil. It was shown that urease was much more sensitive to HM than the other enzymes. There was a obvious negative correlation between the ionic impulsion of HM in soil, the ionic impulsion of HM in canola plants tops and urease activity. It is concluded that the soil urease activity may be a sensitive tool for assessing additive toxic combination effect on soil biochemical parameters.}

      \field{abstract}{In this study, we conducted electrophoretic mobility, potentiometric titration, and metal sorption experiments to investigate the surface charge characteristics of Bacillus subtilis and the electrostatic interactions between metal cations and the cell surface electric field. Electrophoretic mobility experiments performed as a function of pH and ionic strength show an isoelectric point of pH 2.4, with the magnitude of the electrokinetic potential increasing with increasing pH, and decreasing with increasing ionic strength. Potentiometric titration experiments conducted from pH 2.4 to 9 yield an average surface charge excess of 1.6 $\mu$mol/mg (dry mass). Corresponding cell wall charge density values were used to calculate the Donnan potential ($\Psi$DON) as function of pH and ionic strength. Metal sorption experiments conducted with Ca(II), Sr(II), and Ba(II) exhibit strong ionic strength dependence, suggesting that the metal ions are bound to the bacterial cell wall via an outer-sphere complexation mechanism. Intrinsic metal sorption constants for the sorption reactions were determined by correcting the apparent sorption constant with the Boltzmann factor. A 1:2 metal-ligand stoichiometry provides the best fit to the experimental data with log K2int values of 5.9 ± 0.3, 6.0 ± 0.2, 6.2 ± 0.2 for Ca(II), Sr(II), and Ba(II) respectively. Electrophoretic mobility measurements of cells sorbed with Ca(II), Sr(II), and Ba(II) support the 1:2 sorption stoichiometry. These results indicate that electrical potential parameters derived from the Donnan model can be applied to predict metal binding onto bacterial surfaces over a wide range of pH and ionic strength conditions. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.}

      \field{abstract}{Microbial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) play an important role in resisting the shock load of toxic contaminants to microbial aggregates. In order to investigate the surface interaction process of bacteria with heavy metals, in this work, the kinetics and affinity of heavy metal (CdCl2 and PbCl2) binding on Bacillus subtilis with EPS and without EPS were determined using in situ surface plasmon resonance. The binding mechanism between bacteria (with EPS and without EPS) and heavy metals was probed using Fourier-transform infrared spectra. The effect of heavy metals on aggregations of microbial cells with EPS and without EPS was investigated. The results showed that both the binding of Pb2+ and Cd2+ to bacteria with EPS had a similar kinetics process, however Pb2+ bound to bacterial surface without EPS more firmly compared with Cd2+. From our results we theorized that heavy metals changed the protein secondary structures of bacteria without EPS protection, that EPS reduced the influence of heavy metals on microbial aggregation, and that Pb2+ inhibited cell aggregation more easily compared with Cd2+ in the absence of EPS.}

      \field{abstract}{Sorption techniques are widely used to remove heavy metal ions from large volumes of aqueous solutions. Herein, the natural and some artificial materials, such as clay minerals, biosorbents, carbon-nanomaterials, metal oxides, are reviewed as adsorbents in the removal of different heavy metal ions, such as Ni(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), Cd(II), Cs(I), Eu(III), Th(IV), Cr(VI) from large volumes of aqueous solutions. The sorption kinetics and thermodynamics, the influ-ence of environmental factors on the sorption, the possible sorption mechanism of heavy metal ions and the modification of adsorbents on the removal of heavy metal ions are discussed in detail. The sorption properties of the different adsorb-ents are also described. The different methods such as batch sorption techniques and spectroscopy techniques (such as XPS, FTIR, EXAFS, ATR-IR) in the determination of heavy metal ion sorption properties and sorption mechanisms are presented. Different models for the simulation of sorption isotherms and kinetic sorption data are given as a comparison to understand the sorption mechanism. Many amphibolous matters for further research and the necessity in the study of the selective adsorbents in multi-component sorption systems are also summarized.}
