Comments by reviewer
I suggest to address this major revisions prior its acceptance for publish:

Section 1

Modern industrial activities, such as mining and battery manufacturing, continue to introduce
lead pollutants into the environment. This results in the rapid depletion of global reserves
and the introduction of lead pollutants into the environment.

This is repetitive. Rephrase these two sentences into one.

Section 2.2

A spectrophotometer with light at 550 nm was used to measure light absorbed by solution and
infer metabolic activity from the difference between filtered and unfiltered samples

Rephrase this sentence. Suggestion: Light absorption measurements at 550 nm were performer
to infer metabolic activity differences between filtered and unfiltered samples.

Section 2.3

after 3 h exposure to 50 m NaN3
Should be: after 3 h exposure to 50 mM NaN3

Section 3.1

The appearance of new peaks could be indicative of the cell wall rupturing, resulting in the
exposure of various functional groups from the interior off the cell.

Rephrase:
The appearance of new peaks could be indicative of cell wall rupturing, resulting in the exposure
of various functional groups from cell inside.

Section 3.2, paragraph 2
Are the cited experiments performed in the same conditions of scale lead and cell concentration?
Has the process zero order kinetics with respect to lead and cell concentration. If not, consider
rephrasing the paragraph adding a notion of conversion rate instead of time to reach equilibrium.

Figure 3: consider adding error bars, change the markers for each experiment and remove lines
connecting data points.

Comments by reviewer
The manuscript presents experimental studied on the removal of Pb using bacteria. The text
should be revised and english-proofed to make it more understandable. Also, the specific problem
that it is being tackled and the concrete objective of the work should be more clearly stated.
Finally, how can this information be applied in practical terms?
